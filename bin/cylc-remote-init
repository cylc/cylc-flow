(This command is for internal use.)
Install suite service files on a task remote (i.e. a [owner@]host):
    .service/contact: All task -> suite communication methods.
    .service/passphrase: Direct task -> suite communication only.

Content of items to install from a tar file read from STDIN.

    0:
        On success or if initialisation not required:
        - Print SuiteSrvFilesManager.REMOTE_INIT_NOT_REQUIRED if initialisation
          not required (e.g. remote has shared file system with suite host).
        - Print SuiteSrvFilesManager.REMOTE_INIT_DONE on success.
    1:
        On failure.
