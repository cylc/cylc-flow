"""cylc gui [OPTIONS] [REG]
gcylc [OPTIONS] [REG]

This is the cylc Graphical User Interface.

Local suites can be opened and switched between from within gcylc. To connect
to running remote suites (whose passphrase you have installed) you must
currently use --host and/or --user on the gcylc command line.

Available task state color themes are shown under the View menu. To customize
themes copy $CYLC_DIR/conf/gcylcrc/gcylc.rc.eg to $HOME/.cylc/gcylc.rc and
follow the instructions in the file.

To see current configuration settings use "cylc get-gui-config".

In the graph view, View -> Options -> "Write Graph Frames" writes .dot graph
files to the suite share directory (locally, for a remote suite). These can
be processed into a movie by \$CYLC_DIR/dev/bin/live-graph-movie.sh=."""
