usage = """cylc [task] started [OPTIONS]

This command is part of the cylc task messaging interface, used by
running tasks to communicate progress to their parent suite.

The started command reports commencement of task execution (and it
acquires a task lock from the lockserver if necessary). It is
automatically written to the top of task job scripts by cylc and
therefore does not need to be called explicitly by task scripting.

Suite and task identity are determined from the task execution
environment supplied by the suite (or by the single task 'submit'
command, in which case case the message is just printed to stdout).
