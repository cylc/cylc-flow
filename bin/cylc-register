"""cylc [prep] register [OPTIONS] ARGS

Register the suite definition located in PATH (or $PWD) as REG.

This creates the suite run directory, and authentication files in a
sub-directory called ".service/".

Suite names are the same as the directory path under the suite run directory.
They may contain alphanumeric characters plus '_' '-' and '/'.

Example: if the cylc run directory is $HOME/cylc-run (the default) and
/home/bob/suites/test is a suite source directory, then:

% cylc reg nwp/test1 /home/bob/suites/test

will create the following suite run directory:

/home/bob/cylc-run/nwp/test1
`-- .service
    |-- passphrase
    |-- source -> /home/bob/test
    |-- ssl.cert
    `-- ssl.pem

The suite can subsequently be started and targeted by cylc commands using
"nwp/test1" as the name."""
