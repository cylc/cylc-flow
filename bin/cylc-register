"""cylc [prep] register [OPTIONS] ARGS

Register the name REG for the suite definition in PATH. The suite server
program can then be started, stopped, and targeted by name REG. (Note that
"cylc run" can also register suites on the fly).

Registration creates a suite run directory "~/cylc-run/REG/" containing a
".service/source" symlink to the suite definition PATH. The .service directory
will also be used for server authentication files at run time.

Suite names can be hierarchical, corresponding to the path under ~/cylc-run.

  % cylc register dogs/fido PATH
Register PATH/suite.rc as dogs/fido, with run directory ~/cylc-run/dogs/fido.

  % cylc register dogs/fido
Register $PWD/suite.rc as dogs/fido.

  % cylc register
Register $PWD/suite.rc as the parent directory name: $(basename $PWD).

The same suite can be registered with multiple names; this results in multiple
suite run directories that link to the same suite definition.

To "unregister" a suite, delete or rename its run directory (renaming it under
~/cylc-run effectively re-registers the original suite with the new name).

Use of "--redirect" is required to allow an existing name (and run directory)
to be associated with a different suite definition. This is potentially
dangerous because the new suite will overwrite files in the existing run
directory. You should consider deleting or renaming an existing run directory
rather than just re-use it with another suite."""
