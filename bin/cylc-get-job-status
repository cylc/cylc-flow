USAGE: cylc [control] get-job-status TASK-ID ST-FILE JOB-SYS JOB-ID

This command is normally invoked automatically by cylc, to poll for job
status of a task. To determine the current or final state of a task
known to have been submitted previously, the automatically generated
task status file must be interpreted after interrogating the batch queue
(or similar) to see if it is currently waiting, running, or gone
(finished or failed).

Options:
  -h, --help   Print this help message and exit.

Arguments:
  TASK-ID - the task's NAME.CYCLE
  ST-FILE - the task status file (written to the task log directory).
  JOB-SYS - the name of the job submission system, e.g. pbs.
  JOB-ID - the job ID in the job submission system.
