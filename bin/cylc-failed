usage = """cylc [task] failed [OPTIONS] [REASON]

This command is part of the cylc task messaging interface, used by
running tasks to communicate progress to their parent suite.

The failed command reports to successfully complete task execution.
It is automatically called by task job scripts, except in the case of
"detaching tasks" which must do their own completion messaging.

Suite and task identity are determined from the task execution
environment supplied by the suite (or by the single task 'submit'
command, in which case case the message is just printed to stdout).

    cylc [task] message
    cylc [task] started
    cylc [task] succeeded

Arguments:
    REASON        - message explaining why the task failed."""
