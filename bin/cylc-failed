usage = """cylc [task] failed [OPTIONS] [REASON]

This command is part of the cylc task messaging interface, used by
running tasks to communicate progress to their parent suite.

The failed command reports failure of task execution (and releases the
task lock to the lockserver if necessary). It is automatically called in
case of an error trapped by the task job script, but it can also be
called explicitly for self-detected failures if necessary.

Suite and task identity are determined from the task execution
environment supplied by the suite (or by the single task 'submit'
command, in which case case the message is just printed to stdout).

See also:
    cylc [task] message
    cylc [task] started
    cylc [task] succeeded

Arguments:
    REASON        - message explaining why the task failed."""
