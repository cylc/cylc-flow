"""cylc [control] poll [OPTIONS] ARGS

Poll jobs of active tasks (those in the 'submitted' or 'running' states) to
verify or update their statuses - even if they have suffered an external hard
kill.

To poll one or more tasks, "cylc poll REG MATCH POINT"; to poll all active
tasks: "cylc poll REG".

Note that automatic job polling can used to track task status on task hosts
that do not allow any communication by RPC (pyro) or ssh back to the suite host
- see site/user config file documentation.

Polling is also done automatically on restarting a suite, for any tasks that
were recorded as submitted or running when the suite went down.
