"""cylc [control] nudge [OPTIONS] ARGS

Cause the cylc task processing loop to be invoked in a running suite.

This happens automatically when the state of any task changes such that
task processing (dependency negotation etc.) is required, or if a
clock-trigger task is ready to run.

The main reason to use this command is to update the "estimated time till
completion" intervals shown in the tree-view suite control GUI, during
periods when nothing else is happening.
