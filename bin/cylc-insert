"""cylc [control] insert [OPTIONS] ARGS

Insert task proxies into a running suite. Uses of insertion include:
 1) insert a task that was excluded by the suite definition at start-up.
 2) reinstate a task that was previously removed from a running suite.
 3) re-run an old task that cannot be retriggered because its task proxy
 is no longer live in the a suite.

Be aware that inserted cycling tasks keep on cycling as normal, even if
another instance of the same task exists at a later cycle (instances of
the same task at different cycles can coexist, but a newly spawned task
will not be added to the pool if it catches up to another task with the
same ID).

See also 'cylc submit', for running tasks without the scheduler.
