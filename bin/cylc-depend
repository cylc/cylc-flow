"""cylc [control] depend [OPTIONS] ARGS

Add new dependencies on the fly to tasks in running suite REG. If DEP
is a task ID the target TASK will depend on that task finishing,
otherwise DEP can be an explicit quoted message such as
  "Data files uploaded for 2011080806"
(presumably there will be another task in the suite, or you will insert
one, that reports that message as an output).

Prerequisites added on the fly are not propagated to the successors
of TASK, and they will not persist in TASK across a suite restart."""
