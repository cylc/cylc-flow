usage = """1/ cylc [util] housekeeping [OPTIONS] SOURCE MATCH OPER OFFSET [TARGET]
Usage: 2/ cylc [util] housekeeping [options] FILE

Parallel archiving and cleanup of files or directories with names
that contain a cycle point. Matched items are grouped into batches in
which members are processed in parallel, by spawned sub-processes.
Once all batch members have completed, the next batch is processed.

OPERATE ('delete', 'move', or 'copy') on items (files or directories)
matching a Python-style regular expression MATCH in directory SOURCE
whose names contain a cycle point (as YYYYMMDDHH, or YYYYMMDD and HH
separately) more than OFFSET (integer hours) earlier than a base cycle
point (which can be $CYLC_TASK_CYCLE_POINT if called by a cylc task, or
otherwise specified on the command line).

FILE is a housekeeping config file containing one or more of lines of:

   VARNAME=VALUE
   # comment
   SOURCE    MATCH    OPERATION   OFFSET   [TARGET]

(example: $CYLC_DIR/conf/housekeeping.eg)

MATCH must be a Python-style regular expression (NOT A SHELL GLOB
EXPRESSION!) to match the names of items to be operated on AND to
extract the cycle point from the names via one or two parenthesized
sub-expressions - '(\d{10})' for YYYYMMDDHH, '(\d{8})' and '(\d{2})'
for YYYYMMDD and HH in either order. Partial matching can be used
(partial: 'foo-(\d{10})'; full: '^foo-(\d{10})$'). Any additional
parenthesized sub-expressions, e.g. for either-or matching, MUST
be of the (?:...) type to avoid creating a new match group.

SOURCE and TARGET must be on the local filesystem and may contain
environment varables such as $HOME or ${FOO} (e.g. as defined in the
suite.rc file for suite housekeeping tasks). Variables defined in
the housekeeping file itself can also be used, as above.

TARGET may contain the strings YYYYMMDDHH, YYYY, MM, DD, HH; these
will be replaced with the extracted cycle point for each matched item,
e.g. $ARCHIVE/oper/YYYYMM/DD.

If TARGET is specified for the 'delete' operation, matched items in
SOURCE will not be deleted unless an identical item is found in
TARGET. This can be used to check that important files have been
successfully archived before deleting the originals.

The 'move' and 'copy' operations are aborted if the TARGET/item already
exists, but a warning is emitted if the source and target items are not
identical.

To implement a simple ROLLING ARCHIVE of cycle-point labelled files or
directories: just use 'delete' with OFFSET set to the archive length.

SAFE ARCHIVING: The 'move' operation is safe - it uses Python's
shutils.move() which renames files on the local disk partition and
otherwise copies before deleting the original. But for extra safety
consider two-step archiving and cleanup:
1/ copy files to archive, then
2/ delete the originals only if identicals are found in the archive."""
