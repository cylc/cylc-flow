"""cylc [info] review [OPTIONS] ARGS

Start/stop ad-hoc Cylc Review web service server for browsing users' suite
logs via an HTTP interface.

With no arguments, the status of the ad-hoc web service server is printed.

For 'cylc review start', if 'PORT' is not specified, port 8080 is used.

If $CYLC_REVIEW_HOME is defined, look there for run directories instead of
in user home directories. This can be used to view symlinked run directories
directly when home directories are private. For example with symlinking as:
  /home/USER/cylc-run/WORKFLOW -> /project/PROJECT/USER/cylc-run/WORKFLOW
set the environment variable as:
  CYLC_REVIEW_HOME=/project/PROJECT
