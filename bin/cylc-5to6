# Transform a cylc 5 suite rc file into a cylc 6 suite rc file where possible.

Usage: cylc [prep] 5to6 FILE

Suggest changes to a cylc 5 suite file to make it more cylc 6 compatible.
This may be a suite.rc file, an include file, or a suite.rc.processed file.

By default, print the changed file to stdout. Lines that have been changed
are marked with '# UPGRADE'. These marker comments are purely for your own
information and should not be included in any changes you make. In
particular, they may break continuation lines.

Lines with '# UPGRADE CHANGE' have been altered.
Lines with '# UPGRADE ... INFO' indicate that manual change is needed.

As of cylc 7, 'cylc validate' will no longer print out automatic dependency
section translations. At cylc 6 versions of cylc, 'cylc validate' will show
start-up/mixed async replacement R1* section(s). The validity of these can
be highly dependent on the initial cycle point choice (e.g. whether it is
T00 or T12).

This command works best for hour-based cycling - it will always convert
e.g. 'foo[T-6]' to 'foo[-PT6H]', even where this is in a monthly or yearly
cycling section graph.

This command is an aid, and is not an auto-upgrader or a substitute for
reading the documentation. The suggested changes must be understood and
checked by hand.

Example usage:

# Print out a file path (FILE) with suggested changes to stdout.
cylc 5to6 FILE

# Replace the file with the suggested changes file.
cylc 5to6 FILE > FILE

# Save a copy of the changed file.
cylc 5to6 FILE > FILE.5to6

# Show the diff of the changed file vs the original file.
diff - <(cylc 5to6 FILE) <FILE

  -h, --help   Print this help message and exit.
