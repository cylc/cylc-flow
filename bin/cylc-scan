Detect (by port scanning) running cylc suites and lockservers, and
print the results. By default only your own running suites will be
printed.  With --verbose you will also get "Connection Denied" from
running suites owned by others on the same host.

Simple space-delimited output format for easy parsing:
    SUITE OWNER HOST PORT
Here's one way to parse 'cylc scan' output by shell script:
________________________________________________________________
#!/bin/bash
# parse suite, owner, host, port from 'cylc scan' output lines
OFIS=$IFS
IFS=$'\n'; for LINE in $( cylc scan ); do
    # split on space and assign tokens to positional parameters:
    IFS=$' '; set $LINE
    echo "$1 - $2 - $3 - $4"
done
IFS=$OFIS

        "($CYLC_DIR/conf/siterc/site.rc).",
        action="store_true",default=False, dest="print_ports" )

( options, args ) = parser.parse_args()

if options.print_ports:
    base = sitecfg.get( ['pyro','base port'] )
    range = sitecfg.get( ['pyro','maximum number of ports'] )
    print base, '<= port <=', base + range
    sys.exit(0)
