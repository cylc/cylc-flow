usage = """cylc [task] broadcast [OPTIONS] ARGS

This command allows running tasks to broadcast environment variables
(name=value) to other task execution environments (via their job
scripts). Broadcast variables override existing variables of the same
name in the task execution environment. It is up to the user to ensure
that broadcast variable names are unique across the suite, or unique by
cycle time the optional CYCLE argument is used, and that use of
broadcast variables is consistent with the suite dependency structure
(i.e. receiving tasks must be downstream of generating tasks). Note that
cylc task execution environments do not allow use of unset variables 
(supply a default value in task scripting if necessary, e.g.
VAR_THAT_MAY_BE_UNSET=${VARNAME:-DEFAULT}).

Target suite identity is determined from the task execution environment
supplied by the suite. Export CYLC_SUITE_REG_NAME before manual use on
the command line."""
