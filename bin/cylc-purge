Remove an entire tree of dependent tasks, over multiple cycles, from a running
suite. The top task will be forced to spawn and will then be removed, then so
will every task that depends on it, and every task that depends on those, and
so on until the given stop cycle point.

THIS COMMAND IS DANGEROUS.

UNDERSTANDING HOW PURGE WORKS: cylc identifies tasks that depend on the top
task, and then on its downstream dependents, and then on theirs, etc., by
simulating what would happen if the top task were to trigger: it artificially
sets the top task to the "succeeded" state then negotatiates dependencies and
artificially sets any tasks whose prerequisites get satisfied to "succeeded";
then it negotiates dependencies again, and so on until the stop cycle is
reached or nothing new triggers. Finally it marks "virtually triggered" tasks
for removal.  Consequently:
 * Dependent tasks will only be identified as such, and purged, if they have
   already spawned into the top cycle - so let them catch up first.
 * You can't purge a tree of tasks that has already triggered, because the
   algorithm relies on detecting new triggering.
Note that suite runahead must be sufficient enough to bridge the purge gap.""",
