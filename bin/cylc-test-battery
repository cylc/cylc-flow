Usage: cylc test-battery [...]

Run automated Cylc and Parsec tests, under (by default):
   $CYLC_DIR/tests/.

Options and arguments are appended to "prove -j \$NPROC -s -r \${@:-tests}".
NPROC is the number of concurrent processes to run, which defaults to the
global config "process pool size" setting.

The tests ignore normal site/user global config and instead use the file:
   $CYLC_DIR/etc/global-tests.rc
This should specify test job hosts under the [test battery] section, plus any
other critical settings settings, including [hosts] configuration for test job
hosts (and special batchview commands like qcat if available). Additional
global config items can be added on the fly using the create_test_globalrc
shell function defined in the test_header.

Suite run directories are only cleaned up for passing tests on the suite host.

Set "export CYLC_TEST_DEBUG=true" to print failed-test stderr to the terminal.

To change the test file comparision command from "diff -u" do (for example):
   export CYLC_TEST_DIFF_CMD='xxdiff -D'

Some test suites submit jobs to the 'at' so atd must be up on the job hosts.

Commits or Pull Requests to cylc/cylc-flow on GitHub will trigger Travis CI to
run generic (non platform-specific) tests - see $CYLC_DIR/.travis.yml.

By default all tests are executed.  To run just a subset of them:
  * list individual tests or test directories to run on the command line
  * list individual tests or test directories to skip in \$CYLC_TEST_SKIP
  * skip all generic tests with CYLC_TEST_RUN_GENERIC=false
  * skip all platform-specific tests with CYLC_TEST_RUN_PLATFORM=false
  List specific tests relative to $CYLC_DIR (i.e. starting with "test/").
Some platform-specific tests are automatically skipped, depending on platform.

Platform-specific tests must set "CYLC_TEST_IS_GENERIC=false" before sourcing
the test_header.

Tests requiring the sqlite3 CLI must be skipped if sqlite3 is not installed (it
is not otherwise a Cylc software prerequisite):
| if ! which sqlite3 > /dev/null; then
|     # Skip the remaining 3 tests.
|     skip 3 "sqlite3 not installed?"
|     purge_suite \$SUITE_NAME
|     exit 0

Options:
  -h, --help       Print this help message and exit.
  --chunk CHUNK    Divide the test battery into chunks and run the specified
                   chunk. CHUNK takes the format 'a/b' where 'b' is the number
                   of chunks to divide the battery into and 'a' is the number
                   of the chunk to run (1 >= a >= b).

Examples:

Run the full test suite with the default options.
  cylc test-battery
Run the full test suite with 12 processes
  cylc test-battery -j 12
Run only tests under "tests/cyclers/"
  cylc test-battery tests/cyclers
Run only "tests/cyclers/16-weekly.t" in verbose mode
  cylc test-battery -v tests/cyclers/16-weekly.t
Run only tests under "tests/cyclers/", and skip 00-daily.t
  export CYLC_TEST_SKIP=tests/cyclers/00-daily.t
  cylc test-battery tests/cyclers
Run the first quarter of the test battery
  cylc test-battery --chunk '1/4'
Re-run failed tests
  cylc test-battery --state=save
  cylc test-battery --state=failed
eof
