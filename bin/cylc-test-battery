USAGE: cylc test-battery [OPTIONS] [FILES or DIRECTORIES] -- [prove OPTIONS]

Run automated cylc and parsec tests under [FILES or DIRECTORIES].
Test locations default to the following directory tree:
  $CYLC_DIR/tests/

Some tests (e.g. those specific to particular batch schedulers) can be
configured in your site/user config file. A few others still submit jobs
to a user@host account taken from the environment:
  \$CYLC_TEST_TASK_HOST # default localhost
  \$CYLC_TEST_TASK_OWNER # defaut \$USER

Requirements:
  * Passwordless ssh must be configured to task host accounts.
  * Some test suites submit jobs to 'at' so atd must be running.

Suite run directories are cleaned up on the suite host (but not on
remote task hosts) for passing tests - otherwise they are left alone.

By default the command uses the number of processors in your system to
determine the number of tests to run in parallel. This may be anti-social
on systems shared with many other users. On slow or loaded
machines this may result in some test failures due to timeouts intended
to catch problems that can prevent a suite from shutting down normally.
In such cases, you can change the amount of concurrency by setting either:
  * the "-j N" option, or
  * the "process pool size = N" option in the site/user global
    configuration.

To output stderr from failed tests to the terminal, "export CYLC_TEST_DEBUG=true"
before running this command. By default, it uses "diff -u" to compare files.
However, if an alternate command such as "xxdiff -D" is desirable (e.g. for
debugging), "export CYLC_TEST_DIFF_CMD=xxdiff -D".

For more information see "Reference Tests" in the User Guide.

Options:
  -h, --help   Print this help message and exit.

Options after '--' are passed through to "prove".
E.g. to run N tests at once, in parallel:
  cylc test-battery -- -j N      
eof
