USAGE: cylc test-battery [OPTIONS] [SUBSET]

Run a battery of tests held under \$CYLC_DIR/tests/. If SUBSET is specified 
then only run the tests in \$CYLC_DIR/tests/SUBSET.

Some of the tests use suites which submit test jobs to a task host and
user account taken from the environment:
  \$CYLC_TEST_TASK_HOST
  \$CYLC_TEST_TASK_OWNER
These default to localhost and \$USER. Passwordless ssh must be
configured to the task host account (even if it is local).

For passed test suites, log files and suite run directories are automatically 
cleaned up on the suite host, but not on remote task hosts. Test suites that 
fail are kept in the cylc-run directory to allow manual interrogation.

For more information see "Reference Tests" in the User Guide.

Options:
  -h, --help   Print this help message and exit.
  
Supports all the options of "prove".
