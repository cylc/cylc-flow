USAGE: cylc test-battery [OPTIONS] [SUBSET]

Run a battery of tests held under \$CYLC_DIR/tests/[SUBSET].

Some tests (e.g. those specific to particular batch schedulers) can be
configured in your site/user config file. A few others still submit jobs
to a user@host account taken from the environment:
  \$CYLC_TEST_TASK_HOST # default localhost
  \$CYLC_TEST_TASK_OWNER # defaut \$USER
Passwordless ssh must be configured to task host accounts.

Suite run directories are cleaned up on the suite host (but not on
remote task hosts) for passing tests - otherwise they are left alone.

By default $N tests are run at once, in parallel. On slow or loaded
machines this may result in some test failures due to timeouts intended
to catch problems that can prevent a suite from shutting down normally.
Use the "-j N" option to change the amount of concurrency.

For more information see "Reference Tests" in the User Guide.

Options:
  -h, --help   Print this help message and exit.
Other options are passed through to "prove", e.g.:
  -j N         Run N tests at once, in parallel (default $N).
