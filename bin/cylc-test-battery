Usage: cylc test-battery [...]

Run automated cylc and parsec tests under [FILES or DIRECTORIES].
Test locations default to the following directory tree:
  $CYLC_DIR/tests/

Some tests (e.g. those specific to particular batch schedulers) can be
configured in your site/user config file. A few others still submit jobs
to a user@host account taken from the environment:
  \$CYLC_TEST_TASK_HOST # default localhost
  \$CYLC_TEST_TASK_OWNER # defaut \$USER

Requirements:
  * Passwordless ssh must be configured to task host accounts.
  * Some test suites submit jobs to 'at' so atd must be running.

Options and arguments are appended to the "prove -j \$NPROC -s -r \${@:-tests}"
command, where NPROC is the number of child processes that can be used to run
the test files.

Some tests use a clean global config file. If some items from your site config
file are needed in this, e.g. to get remote test hosts working, add them to
$CYLC_DIR/conf/global-tests.rc.

The command normally uses the "process pool size" setting (default=4) in the
site/user global configuration file to determine the number of tests to run in
parallel. You can also change the amount of concurrency with the "-j N" option.

Suite run directories are cleaned up on the suite host for passing tests -
otherwise they are left alone.

To output stderr from failed tests to the terminal,
"export CYLC_TEST_DEBUG=true" before running this command.

The command normally uses "diff -u" to compare files.  However, if an alternate
command such as "xxdiff -D" is desirable (e.g. for debugging), "export
CYLC_TEST_DIFF_CMD=xxdiff -D".

Commits or Pull Requests to cylc/cylc on GitHub will trigger Travis CI to run
generic (non platform-specific) tests - see $CYLC_DIR/.travis.yml.
After enabling Travis CI for your own cylc fork, you can skip generic tests
locally by setting CYLC_TEST_RUN_GENERIC=false.

By default all tests are executed.  To run just a subset of them:
  * list individual tests or test directories to run on the comand line
  * list individual tests or test directories to skip in \$CYLC_TEST_SKIP
  * skip all generic tests with CYLC_TEST_RUN_GENERIC=false
  * skip all platform-specific tests with CYLC_TEST_RUN_PLATFORM=false
  List specific tests relative to $CYLC_DIR (i.e. starting with "test/").
Some platform-specific tests are automatically skipped, depending on platform.
DEVELOPERS: new platform-specific tests must set "CYLC_TEST_IS_GENERIC=false"
before sourcing the test_header.

For more information see "Reference Tests" in the User Guide.

Options:
  -h, --help   Print this help message and exit.

Examples:

Run the full test suite with the default options.
  cylc test-battery
Run the full test suite with 12 processes.
  cylc test-battery -j 12
Run only tests under "tests/cyclers/" with 12 processes.
  cylc test-battery -j 12 tests/cyclers
Run only "tests/cyclers/16-weekly.t" in verbose mode
  cylc test-battery -v tests/cyclers/16-weekly.t
Run only tests under "tests/cyclers/" with 12 processes, and skip 00-daily.t
  export CYLC_TEST_SKIP=tests/cyclers/00-daily.t
  cylc test-battery -j 12 tests/cyclers
