Usage: cylc [prep] jobscript [OPTIONS] REG TASK

Generate a task job script and print it to stdout.

Here's how to capture the script in the vim editor:
  % cylc jobscript REG TASK | vim -
Emacs unfortunately cannot read from stdin:
  % cylc jobscript REG TASK > tmp.sh; emacs tmp.sh

This command wraps 'cylc [control] submit --dry-run'.
Other options (e.g. for suite host and owner) are passed
through to the submit command.

Options:
  -h, --help   Print this usage message.
  -e --edit    Open the jobscript in a CLI text editor.
  -g --gedit   Open the jobscript in a GUI text editor.
  --plain      Don't print the "Task Job Script Generated message."
 (see also 'cylc submit --help')

Arguments:
  REG          Registered suite name.
  TASK         Task ID (NAME.CYCLE_POINT)
__END__
