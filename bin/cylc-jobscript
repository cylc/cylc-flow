USAGE: cylc [prep] jobscript [OPTIONS] REG TASK

Generate a task job script and print it to stdout.

Here's how to capture the script in the vim editor:
  % cylc jobscript REG TASK | vim -
Emacs unfortunately cannot read from stdin:
  % cylc jobscript REG TASK > tmp.sh; emacs tmp.sh

This command wraps 'cylc [control] submit --dry-run'.
Other options (e.g. for suite host and owner) are passed
through to the submit command.

Options:
  -h,--help   - print this usage message.
 (see also 'cylc submit --help')

Arguments:
  REG         - Registered suite name.
  TASK        - Task ID (NAME.CYCLE_POINT)
__END__
}

for arg in "${@}"; do
    if [[ "${arg}" == '-h' ]] || [[ "${arg}" == '--help' ]]; then
        usage
        exit 0
    fi
done

JOBSCRIPT=$(cylc submit --dry-run "${@}" | awk -F= '$1 == "JOB SCRIPT" {print $2}')
if [[ -z "${JOBSCRIPT}" ]]; then
    echo "ERROR: no jobscript generated" >&2
    exit 1
fi
# (only send script contents to stdout)
echo "Task Job Script Generated: ${JOBSCRIPT}" >&2
exec less "${JOBSCRIPT}"
