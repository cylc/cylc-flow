Reload the suite definition at run time. This allows:
 (a) changing task config such as command scripting or environment;
 (b) adding tasks to, or removing them from, the suite definition,
at run time - without shutting the suite down and restarting it. (It is
easy to shut down and restart a cylc suite, but this may be useful if you
don't want to wait for long-running tasks to finish first.)

Note that *defined tasks* can be already be added to or removed from a
running suite with the 'cylc insert' and 'cylc remove' commands. The
reload command allows addition and removal of actual task definitions.
If a new task is definition is added (and used in the graph) you will
still need to manually insert an instance of the task (at a particular
cycle time) into the running suite. If a task definition (and its use in
the graph) is deleted, existing task proxies of the of the deleted type
will run their course after the reload but new instances will not be
spawned. Changes to a task definition will only take effect when the
next task instance is spawned (existing instances will not be affected).
