Tell a suite to reload its definition at run time. All settings
including task definitions, with the exception of suite log
configuration, can be changed on reload. Note that defined tasks can be
be added to or removed from a running suite with the 'cylc insert' and
'cylc remove' commands, without reloading. This command also allows
addition and removal of actual task definitions, and therefore insertion
of tasks that were not defined at all when the suite started (you will
still need to manually insert a particular instance of a newly defined
task). Live task proxies that are orphaned by a reload (i.e. their task
definitions have been removed) will be removed from the task pool if
they have not started running yet. Changes to task definitions take
effect immediately, unless a task is already running at reload time.

If the suite was started with Jinja2 template variables set on the
command line (cylc run --set FOO=bar REG) the same template settings
apply to the reload (only changes to the suite.rc file itself are
reloaded).

If the modified suite definition does not parse, failure to reload will
be reported but no harm will be done to the running suite.""", pyro=True )
