Reload the suite definition at run time. All settings, including task
definitions, can be changed on reload. Note that defined tasks can be
be added to or removed from a running suite with the 'cylc insert' and
'cylc remove' commands, without reloading. This command also allows
addition and removal of actual task definitions, and therefore insertion
of tasks that were not defined at all when the suite started (you will
still need to manually insert a particular instance of a newly defined
task). Live task proxies that are orphaned by a reload (i.e. their task
definitions have been removed) will be removed from the task pool 
if they have not started running yet. Changes to task definitions take
effect immediately, unless a task is already running at reload time.

If the modified suite definition does not parse, failure to reload will
be reported but no harm will be done to the running suite.""", pyro=True )
