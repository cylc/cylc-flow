"""cylc [prep] edit [OPTIONS] ARGS

Edit suite definitions without having to move to their directory
locations, and with optional reversible inlining of include-files. Note
that Jinja2 suites can only be edited in raw form but the processed
version can be viewed with 'cylc [prep] view -p'.

1/cylc [prep] edit SUITE
Change to the suite definition directory and edit the suite.rc file.

2/ cylc [prep] edit -i,--inline SUITE
Edit the suite with include-files inlined between special markers. The
original suite.rc file is temporarily replaced so that the inlined
version is "live" during editing (i.e. you can run suites during
editing and cylc will pick up changes to the suite definition). The
inlined file is then split into its constituent include-files
again when you exit the editor. Include-files can be nested or
multiply-included; in the latter case only the first inclusion is
inlined (this prevents conflicting changes made to the same file).

3/ cylc [prep] edit --cleanup SUITE
Remove backup files left by previous INLINED edit sessions.

INLINED EDITING SAFETY: The suite.rc file and its include-files are
automatically backed up prior to an inlined editing session. If the
editor dies mid-session just invoke 'cylc edit -i' again to recover from
the last saved inlined file. On exiting the editor, if any of the
original include-files are found to have changed due to external
intervention during editing you will be warned and the affected files
will be written to new backups instead of overwriting the originals.
Finally, the inlined suite.rc file is also backed up on exiting
the editor, to allow recovery in case of accidental corruption of the
include-file boundary markers in the inlined file.

The edit process is spawned in the foreground as follows:
  % <editor> suite.rc
Where <editor> is defined in the cylc site/user config files.
