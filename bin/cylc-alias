Register an alias REG2 for suite REG1. Using an alias is equivalent to
using the full suite name, except for the following caveat: aliases are
stored in your local suite db and aliased suites run under their full
name; therefore you can't interact with remote suites via an alias
unless you use '--use-ssh' (for [control] category commands), which
re-invokes the control command on the remote suite host (where the alias
is known).
