"""cylc upgrade-db

Upgrade a pre-cylc-5.4 suite name database to the new cylc-5.4+ format.
This will create a new-format DB if necessary, or if one already exists
it will transfer old registrations to the new DB so long as the suite
names do not conflict. It is safe to run this utility multiple times.

Prior to cylc-5.4 the suite name registration DB was a Python pickle
file stored at $HOME/.cylc/DB.  Since cylc-5.4 it is a directory
$HOME/.cylc/REGDB/ containing one file per registered suite. The
filenames are the suite names, and the file contains key=value pairs:
  shell$ cat $HOME/.cylc/REGDB/my.suite
  title=my suite title
  path=/path/to/my/suite/"""
