usage = """cylc [task] succeeded [OPTIONS]

This command is part of the cylc task messaging interface, used by
running tasks to communicate progress to their parent suite.

The succeeded command reports successful completion of task execution.
It is called automatically by task job scripts, except in the case of
"detaching tasks" which must do their own completion messaging.

Suite and task identity are determined from the task execution
environment supplied by the suite (or by the single task 'submit'
command, in which case the message is just printed to stdout).
