usage = """cylc [task] succeeded [OPTIONS]

This command is part of the cylc task messaging interface, used by
running tasks to communicate progress to their parent suite.

The succeeded command reports successful completion of task execution
(and releases the task lock to the lockserver if necessary). It is
automatically written to the end of task jobs scripts by cylc, except in
the case of detaching tasks (suite.rc: 'manual completion = True'), in
which case it must be called explicitly by final task scripting. 

Suite and task identity are determined from the task execution
environment supplied by the suite (or by the single task 'submit'
command, in which case case the message is just printed to stdout).
