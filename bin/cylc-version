"""cylc [info] version

Print the cylc version invoked at the command line.

Note that "cylc -v,--version" just prints the version string from the main
command interface, whereas this is a proper cylc command that can take the
standard --host and --user options, etc.

For the cylc version of running a suite daemon see
  "cylc get-suite-version"."""
