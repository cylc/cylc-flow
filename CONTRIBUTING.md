# Cylc: How to Contribute

## Report Bugs

Report bugs by opening an issue at [Cylc Issues on
Github](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/issues). Give the Cylc version
affected by the bug (you should test the latest release if possible) and a
recipe to reproduce the problem.

## Request Enhancements

Request enhancements by opening an issue at [Cylc Issues @
Github](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/issues). Describe your use case in
detail.

## Contribute Code

All contributions to Cylc are made via Pull Requests against the *master*
branch of [cylc/cylc-flow](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow). Non-trivial
developments must be discussed and agreed in advance in a [Cylc
Issue](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/issues) as the team may not be able to
consider large changes that appear out of the blue. New contributors should
add their details to the [Code Contributors](#code-contributors) section of
this file as part of their first Pull Request, and reviewers are responsible
for checking this before merging the new branch into *master*.
