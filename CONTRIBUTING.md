## New Contributors

Please add your name to the
[Code Contributors](#code-contributors) section of this file as part of your
first Pull Request (for each Cylc repository you contribute to).


## Contribute Code

We use [semver](https://semver.org/) to separate riskier changes (e.g. new features
& code refactors) from bugfixes to provide more stable releases for production environments.

**Enhancements** are made on the `master` branch and released in the next minor version
(e.g. 8.1, 8.2, 8.3)

**Bugfixes** and minor usability enhancements are made on bugfix branches and
released as the next maintainance version (e.g. 8.0.1, 8.0.2, 8.0.3). E.G. if the issue is on the `8.0.x` milestone, branch off of `8.0.x` to
develop your bugfix, then raise the pull request against the `8.0.x` branch. We will later merge the `8.0.x` branch into `master`.

Feel free to ask questions on the issue or
[developers chat](https://matrix.to/#/#cylc-general:matrix.org) if unsure about
anything.

We use [towncrier](https://towncrier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) for
generating the changelog. Changelog entries are added by running
```
towncrier create <PR-number>.<break|feat|fix>.md --content "Short description"
```
