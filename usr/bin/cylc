# Wrapper script to support multiple installed Cylc & Rose versions. Handles
# Conda and Python virtual environments, and legacy plain installations.
#
# WRAPPER INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION
#---------------------------------------
# - Copy this script as "cylc" into default $PATH, on scheduler and job hosts
# - If using Rose, create a "rose" symlink (ln -s cylc rose)
# - Set CYLC_HOME_ROOT ("EDIT ME" below) to default to the parent directory of
#   installed versions and set the global config locations if necessary
#
# HOW IT WORKS
#-------------
# Intercept "cylc" and "rose" commands and re-invoke them with the version
# selected. If $CYLC_HOME is defined it is used as the installation location.
# Otherwise, the script looks for a directory named "cylc-$CYLC_VERSION"
# (or just "cylc" if $CYLC_VERSION is not defined) in $CYLC_HOME_ROOT and
# $CYLC_HOME_ROOT_ALT.
# Additional legacy logic is used when calling rose with Cylc 7.
#
# CYLC_HOME_ROOT should default to the central release location, in this
# wrapper (see "EDIT ME" below). This must also be done on job hosts.
#
# CYLC_HOME_ROOT_ALT can be set by users to their own release location.
#
# CYLC_HOME can be set by users to a specific version outside of the root
# location(s), e.g. for a venv in a git working copy. This must be set in
# .bashrc so that task jobs see CYLC_HOME too.
#
# CYLC_VERSION does not have to be set by users in their .bashrc because the
# scheduler propagates its own version to task job scripts. If users do specify
# a version in .bashrc they should make sure it defaults to an existing version
# to avoid overriding task job version selection (see User Instructions below).
#
# In Cylc 8+ the scheduler sets CYLC_VERSION=cylc.flow.__version__ in task job
# scripts. __version__ only increments with releases so CYLC_VERSION cannot be
# used for fine-grained selection among (e.g.) git working copies between
# releases. Use CYLC_HOME to select a venv in your cylc-flow git clone.
#
# INSTALLING cylc 8+ RELEASES WITH CONDA
#---------------------------------------
#
# Create environments named cylc-$CYLC_VERSION under a root location such as /opt:
#   $ conda create -p /opt/cylc-8.2.0 cylc=8.2.0
#
# And create a default version symlink "cylc" to the latest version:
#   $ ln -s cylc-8.2.0 cylc
#
# Alternatively use CYLC_ENV_NAME to use Cylc from an arbitrary Conda or Python
# virtual environment:
#
# Create environments with arbitrary names and install cylc:
#   $ conda create cylc-violet-capybara
#   $ conda activate cylc-violet-capybara
#   $ pip install -e <path to cylc>
#   $ conda deactivate
# (or similarly for a native Python venv)
#   $ CYLC_ENV_NAME=cylc-violet-capybara cylc version --long
#   > 8.0.0 (/home/user/miniconda3/envs/cylc-violet-capybara)
#
# n.b. if CYLC_VERSION and CYLC_ENV_NAME are both set, CYLC_ENV_NAME will be
# used and CYLC_VERSION ignored.
#
# INSTALLING cylc-flow 8+ WORKING COPIES WITH PIP FOR DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Create Python virtual environments in-place in your cylc-flow git clones and
# select them using CYLC_HOME in your .bashrc.
#
# Create a new venv and install cylc-flow:
#   $ cd <my-cylc-flow-clone>
#   $ python -m venv venv
#   $ . venv/bin/activate
#   $ pip install -e . 
#
# Set CYLC_HOME in .bashrc to select this venv (see explanation above):
#
# Note you can also `pip install` cylc-flow releases under a common root
# location for CYLC_VERSION based selection, like for Conda:
#   $ CYLC_HOME_ROOT=$HOME/cylc-flow/releases  # (set in this wrapper too)
#   $ python -m venv $CYLC_HOME_ROOT/cylc-8.0a2
#   $ . $CYLC_HOME_ROOT/cylc-8.0a2/bin/activate
#   $ python -m pip install cylc-flow==8.0a2
# But there is no need to do this if you also have full system releases (as
# opposed to cylc-flow only) installed by Conda.
#
# INSTALLING LEGACY cylc 7 RELEASE TARBALLS BY HAND
#--------------------------------------------------
# cylc-flow release tarballs now unpack to (e.g.) cylc-flow-7.9.1. To work with
# this wrapper the directory should be renamed to "cylc-7.9.1". Then follow
# version-specific installation instructions. Running "make" should create a
# file called VERSION that contains just the version string (e.g.) "7.9.1".
#
# INSTRUCTIONS FOR USERS
#-----------------------
# + Set CYLC_HOME_ROOT_ALT in .bashrc to point any local conda releases, e.g.:
#     $ export CYLC_HOME_ROOT_ALT=$HOME/miniconda3/envs
#   (Environments must be named for the cylc version, e.g. "cylc-8.0.2")
# + Set CYLC_VERSION e.g. "8.0.0" to select a version in the root locations
#   - CYLC_VERSION is propagated to task jobs by the scheduler. If you set it
#   in .bashrc it must default to an existing value to avoid overriding jobs:
#       $ export CYLC_VERSION=${CYLC_VERSION:-8.0.0}
#   - Do not explicitly select the default "cylc" symlink as a version
# + Set CYLC_HOME in .bashrc (on scheduler and job hosts) to select a specific
#   version outside of the ROOT location
#   - CYLC_HOME should point to a Cylc 8 venv, or a plain Cylc 7 directory. It
#     must be set in .bashrc so that task jobs see it too
# + Any of these settings in .bashrc must be replicated on job hosts.
