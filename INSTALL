Cylc can run from a raw source tree (at a particular version) or a git
repository clone (which can be updated to the latest version at will).
In either case, cylc can be installed into a normal user home directory
or a system location, so long as the full source tree remains intact.

INSTALLING A SOURCE TARBALL:

  % tar xzf cylc-x.y.z.tar.gz
  % cd cylc-x.y.z
  % make

The make process does the following:

  1) a VERSION file is created containing the cylc version string, e.g.
  5.1.0. This is taken from the name of the parent directory; DO NOT
  CHANGE THE NAME OF THE UNPACKED SOURCE TREE before running 'make'.

  2) generates the Cylc User Guide from its LaTeX source files in doc/:
   * if you have pdflatex installed, a PDF version is generated, and
   * if you have tex4ht and ImageMagick convert installed, two HTML
     versions are generated, and
   * a doc/index.html file is created with links to the generated docs.

  3) The "orrdereddict" Python module will be built from its C language
  source files, in ext/ordereddict-0.4.5. This is not essential - a
  Python implementation will be used by cylc if necessary. Currently, 
  if the build is successful you must install the module yourself into 
  your $PYTHONPATH.

You may want to maintain successive versions of cylc under the same top
level directory:
    TOP/cylc-5.1.0/
    TOP/cylc-5.2.3.
    # etc.

INSTALLING A GIT REPOSITORY CLONE:

  1) To get a clone that can track the official repository:

     % git clone git://github.com/cylc/cylc.git
     % cd cylc
     % make  # build orderreddict and documentation (as above)
     % #...
     % git pull origin master # update latest changes
     % make # remake documentation in case of changes

  2) To participate in cylc development: fork cylc on github, clone your
  own fork locally, commit changes in a feature branch and then push it  
  to your fork and issue a pull request to the cylc maintainer.

In a cylc repository you can re-run make at will to regenerate the
documentation after making changes or updating the repository. Inside
the doc directory you can rebuild specific formats of the User Guide
using special make targets "pdf", "html", "html-single", and
"html-multi".
