INSTALLING CYLC FROM A SOURCE TARBALL

Cylc is typically installed into a designated "cylc admin" user account
(/home/admin/ below, for illustrative purposes).

    % tar xzf cylc-x.y.z.tar.gz
    % cd cylc-x.y.z
    % export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
    % make      # (see below to understand what 'make' does here)

_______________________________________________________________________
ARRANGING ACCESS TO CYLC ONCE INSTALLED

To use cylc you just need the cylc bin directory in your $PATH (on task
host accounts as well as on the suite host). Instead of arranging access
to a specific cylc bin directory, however, you should consider
installing successive versions in parallel like this:

    /home/admin/cylc/cylc-5.2.0/
    /home/admin/cylc/cylc-5.4.0/
        # etc.
    /home/admin/cylc/cylc-5.4.5/
    /home/admin/cylc/cylc -> cylc-5.4.5   # symlink to default version

Now install admin/cylc-wrapper to a convenient location as "cylc", e.g.:

    % cp admin/cylc-wrapper /home/admin/bin/cylc
        # OR
    % cp admin/cylc-wrapper /usr/local/bin/cylc
    
Modify the wrapper for your environment as per instructions in the file
and ensure that it is in $PATH for users. The wrapper selects from the
installed versions via an environment variable $CYLC_VERSION that users
can set if they don't want the default version. Running suites also use
this to ensure that their tasks access the right version of cylc.

CYLC DEVELOPMENT - CLONING THE GIT REPOSITORY

  1) To clone the cylc repository:

     % git clone git://github.com/cylc/cylc.git
     % cd cylc
     % make  # build ordereddict and User Guide (as above)
     % git pull origin master # update official changes
     % make  # remake documentation after changes

  2) To participate in cylc development: fork cylc on github, clone your
  own fork locally, commit changes in feature branches, push them to
  your fork and issue a pull request to the cylc development team.

WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU TYPE 'make'

  1) a VERSION file is created containing the cylc version string, e.g.
  5.1.0. This is taken from the name of the parent directory - DO NOT
  CHANGE THE NAME OF THE UNPACKED SOURCE TREE before running 'make'.  

  2) the Cylc User Guide is generated from LaTeX source files in doc/:
   * if you have pdflatex installed, a PDF version is generated
   * if you have tex4ht and ImageMagick convert installed, two HTML
     versions (single- and multi-page) are generated
   * a doc/index.html is created with links to the generated docs.

  3) A Python module "orrdereddict" will be built from source in
  ext/ordereddict-0.4.5. To make it available to cylc you must install
  the built module into your $PYTHONPATH. This is not essential as a
  Python implementation of the Ordered Dictionary structure will be used
  by cylc if necessary.
