\section{Introduction: How Cylc Works}
\label{HowCylcWorks}

\subsection{Scheduling Forecast Suites}
\label{SchedulingForecastSuites}

Environmental forecasting suites generate forecast products from a
potentially large group of interdependent scientific models and
associated data processing tasks. They are constrained by availability
of external driving data: typically one or more tasks will wait on real
time observations and/or model data from an external system, and these
will drive other downstream tasks, and so on. The dependency diagram for
a single forecast cycle in such a system is a {\em Directed Acyclic
Graph} as shown in Figure~\ref{fig-dep-one} (in our terminology, a {\em
forecast cycle} is comprised of all tasks with a common {\em cycle
time}, which is the nominal analysis time or start time of the forecast
models in the group). In real time operation processing will consist of
a series of distinct forecast cycles that are each initiated, after a
gap, by arrival of the new cycle's external driving data.

From a job scheduling perspective task execution order in such a system
must be carefully controlled in order to avoid dependency violations.
Ideally, each task should be queued for execution at the instant its
last prerequisite is satisfied; this is the best that can be done even
if queued tasks are not able to execute immediately because of resource
contention.

\subsection{EcoConnect}
\label{EcoConnect}

Cylc was developed for the EcoConnect Forecasting System at NIWA
(National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, New Zealand).
EcoConnect takes real time atmospheric and stream flow observations, and
operational global weather forecasts from the Met Office (UK), and uses
these to drive global sea state and regional data assimilating weather
models, which in turn drive regional sea state, storm surge, and
catchment river models, plus tide prediction, and a large number of
associated data collection, quality control, preprocessing,
post-processing, product generation, and archiving tasks.\footnote{Future
plans for EcoConnect include additional deterministic regional weather
forecasts and a statistical ensemble.} The global sea state forecast
runs once daily. The regional weather forecast runs four times daily but
it supplies surface winds and pressure to several downstream models that
run only twice daily, and precipitation accumulations to catchment river
models that run on an hourly cycle assimilating real time stream flow
observations and using the most recently available regional weather
forecast.  EcoConnect runs on heterogeneous distributed hardware,
including a massively parallel supercomputer and several Linux servers.


\subsection{Dependence Between Tasks}

\subsubsection{Intra-cycle Dependence}
\label{IntracycleDependence}

Most dependence between tasks applies within a single forecast cycle.
Figure~\ref{fig-dep-one} shows the dependency diagram for a single
forecast cycle of a simple example suite of three forecast models ({\em
a, b,} and {\em c}) and three post processing or product generation
tasks ({\em d, e} and {\em f}). A scheduler capable of handling this
must manage, within a single forecast cycle, multiple parallel streams
of execution that branch when one task generates output for several
downstream tasks, and merge when one task takes input from several
upstream tasks.

\begin{figure}

    \caption[A single cycle dependency graph for a simple suite]{\scriptsize
    The dependency graph for a single forecast cycle of a simple example
    suite. Tasks {\em a, b,} and {\em c} represent forecast models,
    {\em d, e} and {\em f} are post processing or product generation
    tasks, and {\em x} represents external data that the upstream
    forecast model depends on.}
    \label{fig-dep-one}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=8cm]{graphics/png/orig/timeline-one.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption[A single cycle job schedule for real time operation]{\scriptsize
    The optimal job schedule for two consecutive cycles of our example

    a task bar represents its execution time, and the vertical blue
    lines show when the external driving data becomes available.}
    \label{fig-time-one}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-time-one} shows the optimal job schedule for two
consecutive cycles of the example suite in real time operation, given
execution times represented by the horizontal extent of the task bars.
There is a time gap between cycles as the suite waits on new external
driving data.  Each task in the example suite happens to trigger off
upstream tasks {\em finishing}, rather than off any intermediate output
or event; this is merely a simplification that makes for clearer
diagrams.

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=10cm]{graphics/png/orig/dep-two-cycles-linked.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption[What if the external driving data is available early?]{\scriptsize If
    the external driving data is available in advance, can we start
    running the next cycle early?}
    \label{fig-dep-two-linked}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=6cm]{graphics/png/orig/timeline-one-c.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption[Attempted overlap of consecutive single-cycle job
    schedules]{\scriptsize A naive attempt to overlap two consecutive cycles
    using the single-cycle dependency graph. The red shaded tasks will
    fail because of dependency violations (or will not be able to run

    \label{fig-overlap}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=8cm]{graphics/png/orig/timeline-one-a.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption[The only safe multi-cycle job schedule?]{\scriptsize The best
    that can be done {\em in general} when inter-cycle dependence is
    ignored.}
    \label{fig-job-no-overlap}
\end{figure}

Now the question arises, what happens if the external driving data for
upcoming cycles is available in advance, as it would be after a
significant delay in operations, or when running a historical case
study?  While the forecast model {\em a} appears to depend only on the
external data {\em x} at this stage of the discussion, in fact it would
typically also depend on its own previous instance for the model {\em
background state} used in initializing the new forecast. Thus, as
alluded to in Figure~\ref{fig-dep-two-linked}, task {\em a} could in
principle start
as soon as its predecessor has finished.  Figure~\ref{fig-overlap}
shows, however, that starting a whole new cycle at this point is
dangerous - it results in dependency violations in half of the tasks in
the example suite. In fact the situation could be even worse than this
- imagine that task {\em b} in the first cycle is delayed for some reason
{\em after} the second cycle has been launched. Clearly we must consider
handling inter-cycle dependence explicitly or else agree not to start
the next cycle early, as is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig-job-no-overlap}.

\subsubsection{Inter-cycle Dependence}
\label{IntercycleDependence}

Forecast models typically depend on their own most recent previous
forecast for background state or restart files of some kind (this is
called {\em warm cycling}) but there can also be inter-cycle dependence
between different tasks.  In an atmospheric forecast analysis suite, for
instance, the weather
model may generate background states for observation
processing and data-assimilation tasks in the next cycle as well as for
the next forecast model run. In real
time operation inter-cycle dependence can be ignored because it is
automatically satisfied when one cycle finishes before the next
begins. If it is not ignored it drastically
complicates the dependency graph by blurring the clean boundary
between cycles. Figure~\ref{fig-dep-multi} illustrates the
problem for our simple example suite assuming minimal inter-cycle
dependence: the warm cycled models ($a$, $b$, and $c$) each depend on their
own previous instances.

For this reason, and because we tend to see forecasting suites in terms
of their real time characteristics, other metaschedulers
have ignored inter-cycle
dependence and are thus restricted to running entire cycles in sequence
at all times.  This does not
affect normal real time operation but it can be a serious impediment when
advance availability of external driving data makes it possible, in
principle, to run some tasks from upcoming cycles before the current
cycle is finished - as was suggested at the end of the previous section.
This can occur, for instance, after operational delays (late arrival of
external data, system maintenance, etc.) and to an even greater extent
in historical case studies and parallel test suites started behind a
real time operation. It can be a serious problem for suites that have
little downtime between forecast cycles and therefore take many cycles
to catch up after a delay.
Without taking account of inter-cycle dependence, the
best that can be done, in general, is to reduce the gap between cycles
to zero as shown in Figure~\ref{fig-job-no-overlap}. A limited crude
overlap of the single cycle job schedule may be possible for specific
task sets but the allowable overlap may change if new tasks are added,
and it is still dangerous: it amounts to running different parts of a
dependent system as if they were not dependent and as such it cannot be
guaranteed that some unforeseen delay in one cycle, after the
next cycle has begun, (e.g.\ due to resource contention or task
failures) won't result in dependency violations.

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=8cm]{graphics/png/orig/dep-multi-cycle.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption[The complete multi-cycle dependency graph]{\scriptsize The complete
    dependency graph for the example suite, assuming the least possible
    inter-cycle dependence: the forecast models ($a$, $b$, and $c$)
    depend on their own previous instances. The dashed arrows show
    connections to previous and subsequent forecast cycles.}
    \label{fig-dep-multi}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=6cm]{graphics/png/orig/timeline-two-cycles-optimal.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption[The optimal two-cycle job schedule]{\scriptsize The optimal two
    cycle job schedule when the next cycle's driving data is available in
    advance, possible in principle when inter-cycle dependence is
    handled explicitly.}
    \label{fig-optimal-two}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-optimal-two} shows, in contrast to
Figure~\ref{fig-overlap}, the optimal two cycle job schedule obtained by
respecting all inter-cycle dependence.  This assumes no delays due to
resource contention or otherwise - i.e.\ every task runs
as soon as it is ready to run. The scheduler running
this suite must be able to adapt dynamically to external conditions
that impact on multi-cycle scheduling in the presence of
inter-cycle dependence or else, again, risk bringing the system down
with dependency violations.

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=12cm]{graphics/png/orig/timeline-three.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption[Comparison of job schedules after a delay]{\scriptsize Job
    schedules for the example suite after a delay of almost one whole
    forecast cycle, when inter-cycle dependence is
    taken into account (above the time axis), and when it is not
    (below the time axis). The colored lines indicate the time that
    each cycle is delayed, and normal ``caught up'' cycles
    are shaded gray.}
    \label{fig-time-three}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=8cm]{graphics/png/orig/timeline-two.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption[Optimal job schedule when all external data is
    available]{\scriptsize Job schedules for the example suite in case study
    mode, or after a long delay, when the external driving data are
    available many cycles in advance. Above the time axis is the optimal
    schedule obtained when the suite is constrained only by its true
    dependencies, as in Figure \ref{fig-dep-two-linked}, and underneath
    is the best that can be done, in general, when inter-cycle
    dependence is ignored.}
    \label{fig-time-two}
\end{figure}

To further illustrate the potential benefits of proper inter-cycle
dependency handling, Figure~\ref{fig-time-three} shows an operational
delay of almost one whole cycle in a suite with little downtime between
cycles. Above the time axis is the optimal schedule that is possible in
principle when inter-cycle dependence is taken into account, and below it
is the only safe schedule possible {\em in general} when it is ignored.
In the former case, even the cycle immediately after the delay
is hardly affected, and subsequent cycles are all on time, whilst in the
latter case it takes five full cycles to catch up to normal real time
operation.
%Note that simply overlapping the single cycle schedules of
%Figure~\ref{fig-time-one} from the same start point would have resulted
%in dependency violation by task {\em c}.

Similarly, Figure~\ref{fig-time-two} shows example suite job schedules
for an historical case study, or when catching up after a very long
delay; i.e.\ when the external driving data are available many cycles in
advance.  Task {\em a}, which as the most upstream forecast model is
likely to be a resource intensive atmosphere or ocean model, has no
upstream dependence on co-temporal tasks and can therefore run
continuously, regardless of how much downstream processing is yet to be
completed in its own, or any previous, forecast cycle (actually, task
{\em a} does depend on co-temporal task {\em x} which waits on the
external driving data, but that returns immediately when the
data is available in advance, so the result stands). The other forecast
models can also cycle continuously or with a short gap between, and some
post processing tasks, which have no previous-instance dependence, can
run continuously or even overlap (e.g.\ {\em e} in this case). Thus,
even for this very simple example suite, tasks from three or four
different cycles can in principle run simultaneously at any given time.
In fact, if our tasks are able to trigger off internal outputs of
upstream tasks, rather than waiting on full completion, successive
instances of the forecast models could overlap as well (because model
restart outputs are generally completed early in the forecast) for an
even more efficient job schedule.

%Finally, we note again that a good job scheduler should be able to
%dynamically adapt to delays in any part of the suite due to resource
%contention, varying run times, or anything else that will inevitably
%modify the depicted job schedules.

\subsection{The Cylc Scheduling Algorithm}
\label{TheCylcSchedulingAlgorithm}

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=8cm]{graphics/png/orig/task-pool.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption[The cylc task pool]{\scriptsize How cylc sees a suite, in
    contrast to the multi-cycle dependency graph of Figure~\ref{fig-dep-multi}.
    Task colors represent different cycle times, and the small squares
    and circles represent different prerequisites and outputs. A task
    can run when its prerequisites are satisfied by the outputs
    of other tasks in the pool.}
    \label{fig-task-pool}
\end{figure}

Cylc manages a pool of proxy objects that represent the real tasks in a
suite. Task proxies know how to run the real tasks that they represent,
and they receive progress messages from the tasks as they run (usually
reports of completed outputs). There is no global cycling mechanism to
advance the suite; instead individual task proxies have their own
private cycle time and spawn their own successors when the time is
right. Task proxies are self-contained - they know their own
prerequisites and outputs but are not aware of the wider suite.
Inter-cycle dependence is not treated as special, and the task pool can
be populated with tasks with many different cycle times. The task pool
is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig-task-pool}. {\em Whenever any task
changes state due to completion of an output, every task checks to see
if its own prerequisites have been satisfied.}
%\footnote{In fact this dependency negotiation goes through a broker
%object (rather than every task literally checking every other task)
%which scales as $n$ (rather than $n^2$) where $n$ is the number of task
%proxies in the pool.}
In effect, cylc gets a pool of tasks to self-organize by negotiating
their own dependencies so that optimal scheduling, as described in the
previous section, emerges naturally at run time.

\section{Required Software}
\label{Requirements}

\begin{myitemize}
    \item {\bf Cylc}, the version associated with this document is: \input{cylc-version.txt}. % generated each time by doc/process
        \newline Cylc can be downloaded from from GitHub: \url{http://cylc.github.com/cylc}
    \item {\bf OS: A Linux or Unix variant (including, reportedly, Apple OS X).}
    \item {\bf The Python Language, version 2.5 or later, but not 3.x yet}.
        \newline \url{http://python.org}
    \item {\bf Pyro-3 (Python Remote Objects), version 3.10$+$, latest
        tested 3.16}; not Pyro4 as yet. Pyro is used
        for network communication between server processes (cylc suites)
        and client programs (running tasks, the gcylc GUI, user commands).
        \newline \url{http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pyro/}
    \item {\bf sqlite (a server-less, zero-configuration, SQL database
        engine}). This is likely included in your Linux distribution
        already. Cylc generates an sqlite database for each suite as it
        runs, to record task events and status.
        \newline \url{http://sqlite.org}
\end{myitemize}

The following packages are technically optional as you can construct
and run cylc suites without dependency graphing, the gcylc GUI, or
template processing {\em but this is not recommended, and without
Jinja2 you will not be able to run many of the example suites}:

\begin{myitemize}
    \item {\bf PyGTK}, a Python wrapper for the GTK+ GUI toolkit,
        required for the gcylc GUI.
        PyGTK is included in most Linux Distributions.
        \newline \url{http://www.pygtk.org}
    \item {\bf Graphviz} (latest tested 2.28.0) and {\bf Pygraphviz}
        (latest tested 1.1), a graph layout engine and a Python
        interface to it.
        \newline \url{http://www.graphviz.org}
        \newline \url{http://networkx.lanl.gov/pygraphviz}
    \item {\bf Jinja2}, a template processor for Python (latest tested:
        2.6). Jinja2 allows use of general programming constructs in
        suite definitions.
        \newline \url{http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs}
\end{myitemize}

If you use a binary package manager to install graphviz you may also
need a couple of {\em devel} packages for the pygraphviz build:

\begin{myitemize}
    \item python-devel
    \item graphviz-devel
\end{myitemize}

This user guide can be generated from the \LaTeX source by
running \lstinline=make= in the top level cylc directory after download.
The following \TeX packages are required (but note that the exact
packages required may be somewhat OS or distribution-dependent):

\begin{myitemize}
    \item texlive
    \item texlive-tocloft
    \item texlive-framed
    \item texlive-preprint (for fullpage.sty, formerly in tetex)
\end{myitemize}
And for HTML versions of the User Guide:

\begin{myitemize}
    \item texlive-tex4ht
    \item ImageMagick (for image scaling)
\end{myitemize}

Finally, cylc makes heavy use of Python {\em ordered dictionary}
data structures.  Significant speedup in parsing large suites can be had
by installing the
fast C-coded \lstinline=ordereddict= module by Anthon van der Neut:
\begin{myitemize}
    \item {\bf ordereddict} (latest tested 0.4.5) \newline
        \url{http://www.xs4all.nl/~anthon/Python/ordereddict}
\end{myitemize}
{\em This module is currently included with cylc} under
\lstinline=$CYLC_DIR/ext=, and is built by the top level cylc Makefile.
If you install the resulting library appropriately cylc will
automatically use it in place of a slower Python implementation of
the ordered dictionary structure.

\subsection{Known Version Compatibility Issues}

Cylc should run ``out of the box'' on recent Linux distributions.

For distributed suites the Pyro versions installed on all suite or task
hosts must be mutually compatible. Using identical Pyro versions
guarantees compatibility but may not be strictly necessary because
cylc uses Pyro rather minimally.

\subsubsection{Pyro 3.9 and Earlier}

Beware of Linux distributions that come packaged with old Pyro versions.
Pyro 3.9 and earlier is not compatible with the new-style Python classes
used in cylc. It has been reported that Ubuntu 10.04 (Lucid Lynx),
released in September 2009, suffers from this problem. Surprisingly,
so does Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot), released in October 2011 - and
therefore, presumably, all earlier Ubuntu releases.  Attempting to run
a suite with Pyro 3.9 or earlier installed results in the following
Python traceback:

\lstset{language=Python}
\begin{lstlisting}

\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Apple Mac OSX}

It has been reported that cylc runs fine on OSX 10.6 SnowLeopard, but on
OSX 10.7 Lion there is an issue with constructing proper FQDNs (Fully
Qualified Domain Names) that requires a change to the DNS service.
Here's how to solve the problem:

\begin{myitemize}
    \item Edit \lstinline=/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist= \newline
        by adding \lstinline=<string>-AlwaysAppendSearchDomains</string>= after line 16:
\begin{lstlisting}
<key>ProgramArguments</key>
  <array>
    <string>/usr/sbin/mDNSResponder</string>
    <string>-launchd</string>
        <string>-AlwaysAppendSearchDomains</string>
  </array>
\end{lstlisting}
    \item Now unload and reload the mDNSResponder service:
\begin{lstlisting}
% sudo launchctl unload -w
/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist
% sudo launchctl load -w
/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.mDNSResponder.plist
\end{lstlisting}
\end{myitemize}


\subsection{Other Software Used Internally By Cylc}

Cylc has incorporated a custom-modified version the {\em xdot} graph
viewer (\url{http://code.google.com/p/jrfonseca/wiki/XDot}, LGPL license).


\section{Installation}
\label{Installation}

\subsection{Install The External Dependencies}

First install Pyro, graphviz, Pygraphviz, Jinja2, \TeX, and ImageMagick
using the package manager on your system if possible; otherwise download
the packages manually and follow their native installation documentation.
On a modern Linux system, this is very easy. For example, to install
cylc-5.1.0 on the Fedora 18 Linux distribution:

\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ yum install graphviz       # (2.28)
shell$ yum install graphviz-devel # (for pgraphviz build)
shell$ yum install python-devel   # (ditto)

# TeX packages, and ImageMagick, for generating the Cylc User Guide:
shell$ yum install texlive
shell$ yum install texlive-tex4ht
shell$ yum install texlive-tocloft
shell$ yum install texlive-framed
shell$ yum install texlive-preprint
shell$ yum install ImageMagick

# Python packages:
shell$ easy_install pyro   # (3.16)
shell$ easy_install Jinja2 # (2.6)
shell$ easy_install pygraphviz
	
# (sqlite 3.7.13 already installed on the system)
\end{lstlisting}

If you do not have root access on your intended cylc host machine and
cannot get a sysadmin to do this at system level, see
Section~\ref{LocalInstall} for tips on installing everything to
a local user account.

Now check that everything other than the \LaTeX packages is
installed properly:
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc check-software
Checking for Python >= 2.5 ... found 2.7.3 ... ok
Checking for non-Python packages:
 + Graphviz ... ok
 + sqlite ... ok
Checking for Python packages:
 + Pyro-3 ... ok
 + Jinja2 ... ok
 + pygraphviz ... ok
 + pygtk ... ok
\end{lstlisting}
If this command reports any errors then the packages concerned are not
installed, not in the system Python search path, or (for a local
install) not present in your \lstinline=$PYTHONPATH= variable.

\subsection{Install Cylc}
\label{InstallCylc}

Cylc installs into a normal user account, as an unpacked release tarball
or a git repository clone. See the \lstinline=INSTALL= file in the source
tree for instructions (also listed in Section~\ref{INSTALL}).

\subsubsection{Create A Site Config File}

Site and user config files define some important parameters that affect
all suites, some of which may need to be customized for your site.
Section~\ref{SiteAndUserConfiguration} describes how to generate an
initial site file and where to install it. All legal site and user
config items are defined Appendix~\ref{SiteRCReference}.

\subsection{Automated Tests}
\label{RTAST}

The cylc test battery is primarily intended for developers to check that
changes to the source code don't break existing functionality. Note that
some test failures can be expected to result from suites timing out,
even if nothing is wrong, if you run too many tests in parallel. See
\lstinline=cylc test-battery --help=.  

\subsection{Local User Installation}
\label{LocalInstall}

It is possible to install cylc and all of its software prerequisites
under your own user account. Cylc itself is already designed to be
installed into a normal user account, just follow the instructions above
in Section~\ref{InstallCylc}. For the other packages, depending on the
installation method used for each, it is just a matter of learning
how to change the default install path prefix from, for example,
\lstinline=/usr/local= to \lstinline=$HOME/installed/usr/local= and
then ensuring that the resulting local package paths are set properly
in your \lstinline=PYTHONPATH= environment variable.

\subsubsection{Some Guidelines}

\lstset{language=transcript}

\begin{myitemize}
\item For \lstinline=python setup.py install= installation:
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ python setup.py install --prefix=/my/local/install/path
\end{lstlisting}
\item For building graphviz from source:
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ ./configure --prefix=/my/local/install/path --with-qt=no
shell$ make
shell$ make install
\end{lstlisting}
The graphviz build reportedly may fail on systems that do not have QT
installed, hence the \lstinline@./configure --with-qt=no@ option above.
The graphviz lib and include locations are required when installing
Pygraphviz.
\item The pygraphviz \lstinline=setup.py= file may need to be edited
to point at your local graphviz library and include directories:
\begin{lstlisting}
# setup.py lines 31 and 32
library_path='/path/to/local/graphviz/lib'
include_path='/path/to/local/graphviz/include'
\end{lstlisting}
\item Note that when using \lstinline=python setup.py= or
\lstinline=easy_install= the local install location may need to exist
and it may be need to be present in \lstinline=PYTHONPATH= {\em before}
you initiate the install process.
\end{myitemize}

Finally, check that everything (other than \LaTeX for document
processing) is installed:

\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc check-software
Checking for Python >= 2.5 ... found 2.7.3 ... ok
Checking for non-Python packages:
 + Graphviz ... ok
 + sqlite ... ok
Checking for Python packages:
 + Pyro-3 ... ok
 + Jinja2 ... ok
 + pygraphviz ... ok
 + pygtk ... ok
\end{lstlisting}
If this command reports any errors then the packages concerned are not
installed, not in the system Python search path, or (for a local
install) not present in your \lstinline=$PYTHONPATH= variable.

\subsection{Upgrading To New Cylc Versions}

Upgrading is just a matter of unpacking the new cylc release. Successive
cylc releases can be installed in parallel as suggested in the
\lstinline=INSTALL= file (Section~\ref{INSTALL}).

\section{On The Meaning Of {\em Cycle Time} In Cylc}

You may be accustomed to the idea that a forecasting suite has a
``current cycle time'', which is typically the
analysis time or nominal start time of the main forecast model(s) in the
suite, and that the whole suite advances to the next forecast cycle when
all tasks in the current cycle have finished (or even when a particular
wall clock time is reached, in real time operation). As explained in
the Introduction, this is not how cylc works.

Cylc suites advance by means of individual tasks with private cycle
times independently spawning successors at the next valid cycle time for
the task, not by incrementing a suite-wide forecast cycle. Each task
will be submitted when its own prerequisites are satisfied, regardless
of other tasks with other cycle times running, or not, at the time.
It may still be convenient at times, however, to refer to the ``current
cycle'', the ``previous cycle'', or the ``next cycle'' and so
forth, with reference to a particular task, or in the sense of
all tasks that ``belong to'' a particular forecast cycle.  But keep in
mind that the members of these groups may not be present simultaneously
in the running suite - i.e.\ different tasks may pass through the
``current cycle'' (etc.) at different times as the suite evolves,
particularly in delayed (catch up) operation.



\section{Site And User Configuration Files}
\label{SiteAndUserConfiguration}

Cylc site and user configuration files contain settings that affect all
suites. Some of these, such as the range of network ports used by cylc,
should be set at site level,
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
# cylc site config file
/path/to/cylc/conf/siterc/site.rc
\end{lstlisting}
Others, such as the preferred text editor for suite definitions,
can be overridden by users,
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
# cylc user config file
$HOME/.cylc/user.rc
\end{lstlisting}

The \lstinline=cylc get-site-config= command retrieves current
global settings consisting of cylc defaults overridden by site settings,
if any, overridden by user settings, if any. To generate an
initial site or user config file:
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc get-site-config --print > $HOME/.cylc/user.rc
\end{lstlisting}
Settings that do not need to be changed should be deleted or commented
out of user config files so that they don't override future changes to
the site file.

Legal items, values, and system defaults are documented in the
{\em Site And User Config File Reference}, Section~\ref{SiteRCReference}.

\section{Tutorial}
\label{Tutorial}

This section provides a hands-on tutorial introduction to basic cylc
suite preparation and control. A number of features are not yet touched
on by the tutorial examples, however, so please also read the rest of
the User Guide.

\subsection{User Config File}

Some global parameters affecting cylc's behaviour are defined in a
{\em site config file}, and can be customized per user in
{\em user config files}. For example, to choose the text editor
invoked by cylc on suite definitions:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
# $HOME/.cylc/user.rc
[editors]
    terminal = vim
    gui = gvim -f
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{myitemize}
\item For more on site and user config files, including how to generate
one at first, see Section~\ref{SiteAndUserConfiguration} and
Appendix~\ref{SiteRCReference}.
\end{myitemize}


\subsection{User Interfaces}
\label{CUI}

Cylc has command line (CLI) and graphical (GUI) user interfaces.
To get access to them you just need the cylc bin directory in your shell
search path:
\lstset{language=bash}
\begin{lstlisting}
export PATH=/path/to/cylc/bin:$PATH
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Command Line (CLI)}

The command line interface is unified under a single top level
\lstinline=cylc= command that provides access to many sub-commands
and their help documentation.
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc help       # top level command help
shell$ cylc run --help # example command-specific help
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{myitemize}
    \item Command help transcripts are also printed in
        Appendix~\ref{CommandReference}, and can be accessed
        from the \lstinline=cylc gui= Help menu.
\end{myitemize}

\subsubsection{Graphical (GUI)}

The cylc GUI covers the same functionality as the CLI with the addition
of live suite monitoring capability, and it is intended to be easier to
use without expert knowledge.  It can start and stop suites, or connect
to suites that are already running; in either case, shutting down the
GUI does not have affect the suite itself.
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ gcylc & # or:
shell$ cylc gui &
shell$ cylc gsummary & # summary GUI for multiple running suites
\end{lstlisting}
Clicking on a suite in the summary GUI, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-gsummary}, opens a gcylc instance for it.

\subsection{Suite Definitions}

Cylc suites are defined by extended-INI format \lstinline=suite.rc=
files (the main file format extension is section nesting). These reside
in {\em suite definition directories} that may also contain a
\lstinline=bin= directory and any other suite-related files.

\begin{myitemize}
\item For more on the suite definition file format, see
    Section~\ref{SuiteDefinition} and Appendix~\ref{SuiteRCReference}.
\end{myitemize}

\subsection{Suite Name Registration}

Suite registration associates a name with a suite definition directory,
in a simple database.  Cylc commands that parse suite definition files
can take the file path or the suite name as input; commands that
interact with running suites have to target the suite by name.
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
# target a suite by file path:
shell$ cylc validate /path/to/my/suite/suite.rc
shell$ cylc graph /path/to/my/suite/suite.rc
# register a name for a suite:
shell$ cylc register my.suite /path/to/my/suite/
# target a suite by name:
shell$ cylc graph my.suite
shell$ cylc validate my.suite
shell$ cylc run my.suite
shell$ cylc stop my.suite
# etc.
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{myitemize}
\item For more on registering, copying, deleting, and renaming suites,
see \lstinline=cylc db --help=, Section~\ref{SuiteRegistration} (Suite
Registration and Passphrases), and Section~\ref{SuiteStorageEtc} (Suite
Storage, Discovery, Revision Control, and Deployment).
\end{myitemize}

\subsection{Suite Passphrases}
\label{tutPassphrases}

At registration time a random string of characters is written to a
file called \lstinline=passphrase= in the suite definition directory.
At run time any contact from cylc client programs (running tasks, user
commands, the cylc GUI) must use the same passphrase to authenticate
with the running suite. This prevents unauthorized users interfering in
your suites (network communication between running processes is not
subject to Unix user account permissions). Local tasks and user commands
on the suite host automatically use the passphrase in the suite
definition directory. For remote tasks and commands, however, the
passphrase must be installed appropriately on the remote
account - see Section~\ref{RemoteTasks} below.

\subsection{Import The Example Suites}
\label{ImportTheExampleSuites}

Run the following command to import cylc's example suites to a chosen
directory location and register them for use under the {\em examples}
name group:
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc import-examples $TMPDIR examples
\end{lstlisting}
(first check that \lstinline=$TMPDIR= is defined in your environment, or
else use a different location). List the newly registered tutorial
suites using the \lstinline=cylc print= command:
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc db print examples.tutorial -y
examples.tutorial.oneoff.jinja2   /tmp/examples/tutorial/oneoff/jinja2
examples.tutorial.cycling.two     /tmp/examples/tutorial/cycling/two
examples.tutorial.cycling.three   /tmp/examples/tutorial/cycling/three
examples.tutorial.oneoff.remote   /tmp/examples/tutorial/oneoff/remote
# ...
\end{lstlisting}
See \lstinline=cylc db print --help= for other display options. The
tree-form display shows how hierarchical suite names can be used to
organize related suites nicely (suite names do not have to be related
to their source directory paths, although they are in this case):
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc db pr --tree -x examples.tutorial
examples
 `-tutorial
   `-cycling
   | |-four       Inter-cycle dependence + a start-up task
   | | ...
   | |-two        Two cycling tasks with inter-cycle dependence
   | `-three      Intercycle dependence + an asynchronous task
   `-oneoff
     |-retry      A task with automatic retry on failure
     |-remote     Hello World! on a remote host
     | ...
     |-basic      The cylc Hello World! suite
     `-jobsub     Hello World! by 'at' job submission
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Rename The Imported Tutorial Suites}
\
Rename (re-register) the tutorial suites to make their names a bit
shorter:
\begin{lstlisting}
$ cylc rereg examples.tutorial tut
REREGISTER examples.tutorial.oneoff.jinja2 to tut.oneoff.jinja2
#...
shell$ cylc db print -x tut
tut.oneoff.external   Hello World! from an external task script
# ...
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Suite Validation}

Suite definitions can be validated against the \lstinline=suite.rc=
file format specification to detect many types of error without running
the suite.
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
# pass:
shell$ cylc validate tut.oneoff.basic
Suite tut.oneoff.basic is valid for cylc-5.3.0
shell$ echo $?
0
# fail:
shell$ cylc validate my.bad.suite
'Illegal item: [scheduling]special tusks'
shell$ echo $?
1
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Hello World in Cylc}

\hilight{ suite: \lstinline=tut.oneoff.basic= }
\vspace{3mm}

Here's the traditional {\em Hello World} program rendered as a cylc
suite:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\lstinputlisting{../examples/tutorial/oneoff/basic/suite.rc}
\lstset{language=transcript}

Cylc suites feature a clean separation of scheduling configuration,
which determines {\em when} tasks are ready to run; and runtime
configuration, which determines {\em what} to run (and {\em where} and
{\em how} to run it) when a task is ready. In this example the
\lstinline=[scheduling]= section defines a single task called
\lstinline=hello= that triggers immediately when the suite starts
up. When the task finishes the suite shuts down. That this is a
{\em dependency graph} will be more obvious when more tasks are added.
Under the \lstinline=[runtime]= section the
\lstinline=command scripting= item defines a simple inlined
implementation for \lstinline=hello=: it sleeps for ten seconds,
then prints \lstinline=Hello World!=, and exits. This ends up in a {\em
job script} generated by cylc to encapsulate the task (below) and,
thanks to some defaults designed to allow quick
prototyping of new suites, it is submitted to run as a background job on
the suite host. In fact cylc even provides a default task implementation
that makes the entire \lstinline=[runtime]= section technically optional:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\lstinputlisting{../examples/tutorial/oneoff/minimal/suite.rc}
\lstset{language=transcript}
(the resulting {\em dummy task} just prints out some identifying
information and exits).

\subsection{Editing Suites}

The text editor invoked by cylc on suite definitions is determined
by cylc site and user config files, as shown above in Section~\ref{CUI}.
Check that you have renamed the tutorial examples suites as described
just above and open the {\em Hello World} suite definition in your text
editor:
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc edit tut.oneoff.basic # in-terminal
shell$ cylc edit -g tut.oneoff.basic & # or GUI
\end{lstlisting}
Alternatively, start gcylc on the suite,
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ gcylc tut.oneoff.basic &
\end{lstlisting}
and choose {\em Suite } $\rightarrow$ {\em Edit} from the menu.

The editor will be invoked from the suite definition directory
for easy access to other suite files (in this case there are
none).  There are syntax highlighting control files for several text
editors under \lstinline=/path/to/cylc/conf/=; see in-file comments
for installation instructions.

\subsection{Running Suites}
\label{RunningSuitesCLI}

\subsubsection{CLI}
Run the suite at the terminal with the \lstinline=cylc run= command:

\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc run --no-detach tut.oneoff.basic
*************************************************************************

    1>/home/hilary/cylc-run/tut.oneoff.basic/log/job/hello.1.1.out
    2>/home/hilary/cylc-run/tut.oneoff.basic/log/job/hello.1.1.err &
    echo $!; wait )

  * hello.1 succeeded at 2013-09-20T13:51:46

Initiating suite shutdown
DONE
\end{lstlisting}
The \lstinline=--no-detach= option tells cylc not to daemonize so that
output is printed to the terminal. When the task is
ready to run cylc generates a special {\em job script} to run
it. The command line used to submit the job script, which depends on the
task's job submission method and host machine, is printed to suite
stdout.  Messages subsequently received from the running task are
also printed. More detailed information is written, time-stamped, to
a {\em suite log}. The suite automatically shuts down when and if
all tasks have succeeded.

\subsubsection{GUI}

The cylc GUI can start and stop suites, or (re)connect to suites that
are already running:
\lstinline=gcylc=
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc gui tut.oneoff.basic &
\end{lstlisting}
use the tool bar {\em Play} button, or the {\em Control}
$\rightarrow$ {\em Run} menu item, to run the suite again.
You may want to alter the suite definition slightly to make the task
take longer to run. Try right-clicking on the \lstinline=hello= task
to view its output logs. The relative merits of the three {\em suite
views} - dot, tree, and graph - will be more apparent later when we
have more tasks. Closing the GUI does not affect the suite itself.

\subsection{Discovering Running Suites}

Suites that are currently running can be detected with command line or
GUI tools:
\begin{lstlisting}
# list currently running suites and their port numbers:
shell$ cylc scan
# GUI summary view of running suites:
shell$ cylc gsummary &
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{graphics/png/orig/gsummary.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption{The \lstinline=cylc gsummary= GUI}
\label{fig-gsummary}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Task Identifiers}

At run time, task instances are identified by {\em name}, which is
determined entirely by the suite definition, and a {\em cycle time} or
integer {\em tag}:
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
foo.2010080800   # a cycling task
bar.1            # a non-cycling task
\end{lstlisting}
Non-cycling tasks usually just have the tag \lstinline=1=, but this
still has to be used to target the task instance with cylc commands.

\subsection{Job Submission: How Tasks Are Executed}

\hilight{ suite: \lstinline=tut.oneoff.jobsub= }
\vspace{3mm}

Task {\em job scripts} are generated by cylc to wrap the task
implementation specified in the suite definition (environment,
command scripting, etc.) in error trapping code and cylc messaging
calls to report task progress back to the suite. Job scripts are saved
to the {\em suite run directory} - the location can be seen in the job
submission commands printed to suite stdout.  They can be viewed by
right-clicking on the task in the cylc GUI, or printed to the terminal:
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc log tut.oneoff.basic hello.1
\end{lstlisting}
Or a new job script can be generated on the fly for inspection,
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc jobscript tut.oneoff.basic hello.1
\end{lstlisting}

Take a look at the job script generated for \lstinline=hello.1= during
the suite run above.  The command scripting should be clearly visible
toward the bottom of the file.

The \lstinline=hello= task in the first tutorial suite defaults to
running as a background job on the suite host. To submit it to the Unix
\lstinline=at= scheduler instead, configure its job submission settings
as in \lstinline=tut.oneoff.jobsub=:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[runtime]
    [[hello]]
        command scripting = "sleep 10; echo Hello World!"
        [[[job submission]]]
            method = at
\end{lstlisting}
If you run the suite (first check that the {\em at daemon}
\lstinline=atd= is running on the suite host) a different,
\lstinline=at=-specific job submission command will be used and printed
to stdout:
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc run --no-detach tut.oneoff.jobsub
#...
1 task ready
  * hello.1 submitting now
SUBMIT No.1(1,1):
    (echo "/home/hilary/cylc-run/tut.oneoff.jobsub/hello.1.1 \
     1>/home/hilary/cylc-run/tut.oneoff.jobsub/hello.1.1.out \
     2>/home/hilary/cylc-run/tut.oneoff.jobsub/hello.1.1.err" | at now)
  * hello.1 submission succeeded
  * hello.1 started at 2013-09-28T17:25:07
  * hello.1 submit_method_id=2191
  * hello.1 succeeded at 2013-09-28T17:25:17
\end{lstlisting}
Cylc supports a number of different job submission methods. Tasks
submitted to external batch queuing systems like \lstinline=at=,
\lstinline=PBS=, \lstinline=SLURM=, or \lstinline=loadleveler=, will
be displayed as {\em submitted} in cylc until they actually start
executing.

\begin{myitemize}
\item For more on task job scripts, see Section~\ref{JobScripts}.
\item For more on job submission methods, see Section~\ref{AvailableMethods}.
\end{myitemize}

\subsection{Locating Suite And Task Output}

If the \lstinline=--no-detach= option is not used, suite stdout and
stderr will be directed to the suite run directory along with the
time-stamped suite log file, and task job scripts and job logs
(task stdout and stderr). The default suite run directory location is
\lstinline=$HOME/cylc-run=:

\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ tree $HOME/cylc-run/tut.oneoff.basic/
|-- cylc-suite.db       # suite run database
|-- cylc-suite-env      # suite environment file
|-- log                 # suite log files
|   |-- job                 # task job logs
|   |   |-- hello.1.1           # task job script
|   |   |-- hello.1.1.err       # task stderr log
|   |   |-- hello.1.1.out       # task stdout log
|   |   `-- hello.1.1.status    # task status file
|   `-- suite               # suite server logs
|       |-- err                 # suite stderr log
|       |-- log                 # suite event log
|       `-- out                 # suite stdout log
|-- state               # suite state dump files
|   |-- state
|   |-- state-1
|   `-- state-2
|-- share               # suite share directory
`-- work                # suite work directory
\end{lstlisting}
The suite run database, suite environment file, suite state files,
and task status files are used internally by cylc. Tasks execute in
sub-directories of \lstinline=work/=, which are automatically deleted
if empty when the task finishes. The suite
\lstinline=share/= directory is made available to all tasks (by
\lstinline=$CYLC_SUITE_SHARE_DIR=) as a common share space. Job log
filenames have the {\em task try number} appended
(here just $1$) - this increments from $1$ if a task is configured to
retry on failure, to avoid overwriting the logs from previous tries.

The top level run directory location can be changed in site and user
config files if necessary, and the suite share and work locations can be
configured separately because of the potentially larger disk space
requirement.

Task job logs can be viewed by right-clicking on tasks in the gcylc
GUI (so long as the task proxy is live in the suite), manually
accessed from the log directory (of course), or printed to the terminal
with the \lstinline=cylc log= command:
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
# suite logs:
shell$ cylc log    tut.oneoff.basic           # suite event log
shell$ cylc log -o tut.oneoff.basic           # suite stdout log
shell$ cylc log -e tut.oneoff.basic           # suite stderr log
# task logs:
shell$ cylc log    tut.oneoff.basic hello.1   # task job script
shell$ cylc log -o tut.oneoff.basic hello.1   # task stdout log
shell$ cylc log -e tut.oneoff.basic hello.1   # task stderr log
\end{lstlisting}
For a more sophisticated web-based interface to suite and task logs,
see {\em Rose} in Section~\ref{SuiteStorageEtc}.
\begin{myitemize}
    \item For more on environment variables supplied to tasks,
    such as \lstinline=$CYLC_SUITE_SHARE_DIR=, see
    Section~\ref{TaskExecutionEnvironment}.
\end{myitemize}

\subsection{Remote Tasks}
\label{RemoteTasks}

\hilight{ suite: \lstinline=tut.oneoff.remote= }
\vspace{3mm}

The \lstinline=hello= task in the first two tutorial suites defaults to
running on the suite host. To make it run on a remote host instead
change its runtime configuration as in \lstinline=tut.oneoff.remote=:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[runtime]
    [[hello]]
        command scripting = "sleep 10; echo Hello World!"
        [[[remote]]]
            host = server1.niwa.co.nz
\end{lstlisting}

For remote task hosting to work several requirements must be satisfied:
\begin{myitemize}

\item Passwordless ssh must be enabled from the suite host account to
the task host account, for task job submission.

\item Networking settings must allow communication {\em back} from
the task host to the suite host, either by network ports (Pyro) or ssh,
unless the last-resort one way {\em task polling} communication method
is used.

\item Cylc must be installed on the task host, and for the default task
    communication method so must Pyro. Other software dependencies like
    graphviz and Jinja2 are not required there.

\item The suite passphrase must be installed on the remote account,
to allow remote tasks to authenticate with the suite.

\item Any files needed by a remote task must be installed on the task
host. In this example there is nothing to install because the
implementation of \lstinline=hello= is inlined in the suite definition
and thus ends up entirely contained within the task job script.

\end{myitemize}

If your username is different on the task host the
\lstinline=[[[remote]]]= section also supports an
\lstinline@owner=username@ item, or your \lstinline=$HOME/.ssh/config=
file can be configured for username translation.

If you configure a task host according to the requirements above and run
the suite again you'll see that the job submission command printed to
suite stdout is now considerably more complicated. That's because it has
to create remote log directories, source login scripts to ensure cylc is
visible on the remote host, pipe the task job script over, and submit it
to run there by the configured job submission method:

\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc run --no-detach tut.oneoff.remote
# ...
1 task ready
  * hello.1 submitting now
SUBMIT No.1(1,1): ssh -oBatchMode=yes server1.niwa.co.nz \
    "test -f /etc/profile && . /etc/profile 1>/dev/null 2>&1; \

Remote task job logs are saved to the suite run directory on
the task host, not on the suite host, although they can be
retrieved by right-clicking on the task in the GUI. Rose
(section~\ref{Rose}) provides a task event handler to pull logs back to
the suite host.

\subsection{Task Triggering}

\hilight{ suite: \lstinline=tut.oneoff.goodbye= }
\vspace{3mm}

To make a second task called \lstinline=goodbye= trigger after
\lstinline=hello= finishes successfully, return to the original
example, \lstinline=tut.oneoff.basic=, and change the suite graph
as in \lstinline=tut.oneoff.goodbye=:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = "hello => goodbye"
\end{lstlisting}
or to trigger it at the same time as \lstinline=hello=,
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = "hello & goodbye"
\end{lstlisting}
and configure the new task's behaviour under \lstinline=[runtime]=:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[runtime]
    [[goodbye]]
        command scripting = "sleep 10; echo Goodbye World!"
\end{lstlisting}

Run \lstinline=tut.oneoff.goodbye= and check the output from the new
task:
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cat ~/cylc-run/tut.oneoff.goodbye/log/job/goodbye.1.1.out
# (or cylc log -o tut.oneoff.goodbye goodbye.1
JOB SCRIPT STARTING

JOB SCRIPT EXITING (TASK SUCCEEDED)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Failure And Suicide Triggering}

\hilight{ suite: \lstinline=tut.oneoff.suicide= }
\vspace{3mm}

Task names in the graph string can be qualified with a state indicator
to trigger off task states other than success:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
    graph = """
 a => b        # trigger b if a succeeds
 c:submit => d # trigger d if c submits
 e:finish => f # trigger f if e succeeds or fails
 g:start  => h # trigger h if g starts executing
 i:fail   => j # trigger j if i fails
            """
\end{lstlisting}

A common use of this is to automate recovery from known modes of failure:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
    graph = "goodbye:fail => really_goodbye"
\end{lstlisting}
i.e. if task \lstinline=goodbye= fails, trigger another task that
(presumably) really says goodbye.

Failure triggering generally requires use of {\em suicide triggers} as
well, to remove the recovery task if it isn't required (otherwise it
would hang about indefinitely in the waiting state):
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = """hello => goodbye
            goodbye:fail => really_goodbye
         goodbye => !really_goodbye # suicide"""
\end{lstlisting}
This means if \lstinline=goodbye= fails, trigger
\lstinline=really_goodbye=; and otherwise, if \lstinline=goodbye=
succeeds, remove \lstinline=really_goodbye= from the suite.

Try running \lstinline=tut.oneoff.suicide=, which also configures
the \lstinline=hello= task's runtime to make it fail, to see how this
works.
\begin{myitemize}
    \item For more on suite dependency graphs see Section~\ref{ConfiguringScheduling}.
    \item For more on task triggering see Section~\ref{TriggerTypes}.
\end{myitemize}

\subsection{Runtime Inheritance}

\hilight{ suite: \lstinline=tut.oneoff.inherit= }
\vspace{3mm}

The \lstinline=[runtime]= section is actually a {\em multiple
inheritance} hierarchy.  Each subsection is a {\em namespace} that
represents a task, or if it inherits from other namespaces, a {\em
family}.  This allows common configuration to be factored out of related
tasks very efficiently.
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\lstinputlisting{../examples/tutorial/oneoff/inherit/suite.rc}
The \lstinline=[root]= namespace is at the root of all runtime
hierarchies. It provides defaults for all tasks in the suite. Here both
tasks inherit command scripting from \lstinline=root=, which they
customize with different values of the environment variable
\lstinline=$GREETING=. Note that inheritance from \lstinline=root= is
implicit; from other parents an explicit \lstinline@inherit = PARENT@
is required, as shown below.

\begin{myitemize}
\item For more on runtime inheritance, see Section~\ref{NIORP}.
\end{myitemize}

\subsection{Triggering Families}

\hilight{ suite: \lstinline=tut.oneoff.ftrigger1= }
\vspace{3mm}

Task families defined by runtime inheritance can also be used as
shorthand in graph trigger expressions. To see this, consider two
``greeter'' tasks that trigger off another task \lstinline=foo=,
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = "foo => greeter_1 & greeter_2"
\end{lstlisting}
If we put the common greeting functionality of \lstinline=greeter_1=
and \lstinline=greeter_2= into a special \lstinline=GREETERS= family,
the graph can be expressed more efficiently like this:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = "foo => GREETERS"
\end{lstlisting}
i.e.\ if \lstinline=foo= succeeds, trigger all members of
\lstinline=GREETERS= at once.  Here's the full suite with runtime
hierarchy shown:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\lstinputlisting{../examples/tutorial/oneoff/ftrigger1/suite.rc}

Verbose validation shows the family member substitution done
when the suite definition is parsed:
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc val -v tut.oneoff.ftr1gger1
...
Graph line substitutions occurred:
  IN: foo => GREETERS
  OUT: foo => greeter_1 & greeter_2
...
\end{lstlisting}

Experiment with the \lstinline=tut.oneoff.ftrigger1= suite to see
how this works.

\subsection{Triggering Off Families}

\hilight{ suite: \lstinline=tut.oneoff.ftrigger2= }
\vspace{3mm}

Tasks (or families) can also trigger {\em off} other families, but
in this case we need to specify what the trigger means in terms of
the upstream family members. Here's how to trigger another task
\lstinline=bar= if all members of \lstinline=GREETERS= succeed:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = """foo => GREETERS
            GREETERS:succeed-all => bar"""
\end{lstlisting}
Verbose validation in this case reports:
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc val -v tut.oneoff.ftrigger2
...
Graph line substitutions occurred:
  IN: GREETERS:succeed-all => bar
  OUT: greeter_1:succeed & greeter_2:succeed => bar
...
\end{lstlisting}
Cylc ignores family member qualifiers like \lstinline=succeed-all= on
the right side of a trigger arrow, where they don't make sense, to
allow the two graph lines above to be combined in simple cases:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = "foo => GREETERS:succeed-all => bar"
\end{lstlisting}

Any task triggering status qualified by \lstinline=-all= or
\lstinline=-any=, for the members, can be used with a family trigger.
For example, here's how to trigger \lstinline=bar= if all members
of \lstinline=GREETERS= finish (succeed or fail) and any of them them
succeed:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = """foo => GREETERS
    GREETERS:finish-all & GREETERS:succeed-any => bar"""
\end{lstlisting}
(use of \lstinline@GREETERS:succeed-any@ by itself here would trigger
\lstinline=bar= as soon as any one member of \lstinline=GREETERS=
completed successfully). Verbose validation now begins to show how
family triggers can simplify complex graphs, even for this tiny
two-member family:
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc val -v tut.oneoff.ftrigger2
...
Graph line substitutions occurred:
  IN: GREETERS:finish-all & GREETERS:succeed-any => bar
  OUT: ( greeter_1:succeed | greeter_1:fail ) & \
       ( greeter_2:succeed | greeter_2:fail ) & \
       ( greeter_1:succeed | greeter_2:succeed ) => bar
...
\end{lstlisting}

Experiment with \lstinline=tut.oneoff.ftrigger2= to see how this
works.

\begin{myitemize}
\item For more on family triggering, see Section~\ref{FamilyTriggers}.
\end{myitemize}

\subsection{Suite Visualization}

\lstset{language=suiterc}
You can style dependency graphs with an optional
\lstinline=[visualization]= section, as shown in
\lstinline=tut.oneoff.ftrigger2=:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[visualization]
    default node attributes = "style=filled"
    [[node attributes]]
        foo = "fillcolor=#6789ab", "color=magenta"
        GREETERS = "fillcolor=#ba9876"
        bar = "fillcolor=#89ab67"
\end{lstlisting}

To display the graph in an interactive viewer,
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc graph tut.oneoff.ftrigger2 &    # dependency graph
shell$ cylc graph -n tut.oneoff.ftrigger2 & # runtime inheritance graph
\end{lstlisting}
It should look like Figure~\ref{fig-tut-hello-multi} (with the
GREETERS family node expanded on the right).
\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[height=0.3\textheight]{graphics/png/orig/tut-hello-multi-1.png}
        \hspace{20mm}
        \includegraphics[height=0.3\textheight]{graphics/png/orig/tut-hello-multi-2.png}
        \hspace{20mm}
        \includegraphics[height=0.3\textheight]{graphics/png/orig/tut-hello-multi-3.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption{The {\em tut.oneoff.ftrigger2} dependency and runtime inheritance graphs}
\label{fig-tut-hello-multi}
\end{figure}

Graph styling can be applied to entire families at once, and custom
``node groups'' can also be defined for non-family groups.


\subsection{External Task Scripts}

\hilight{ suite: \lstinline=tut.oneoff.external= }
\vspace{3mm}

The tasks in our examples so far have all had inlined implementation, in
the suite definition, but real tasks often need to call external
commands, scripts, or executables. To try this, let's return to the
basic Hello World suite and cut the implementation of the task
\lstinline=hello= out to a file \lstinline=hello.sh= in the suite
bin directory:
\lstset{language=bash}
\lstinputlisting{../examples/tutorial/oneoff/external/bin/hello.sh}
Make the task script executable, and change the \lstinline=hello= task
runtime section to invoke it:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\lstinputlisting{../examples/tutorial/oneoff/external/suite.rc}

If you run the suite now the new greeting from the external task script
should appear in the \lstinline=hello= task stdout log. This works
because cylc automatically adds the suite bin directory to
\lstinline=$PATH= in the environment passed to tasks via their job
scripts. To execute scripts (etc.) located elsewhere you can
refer to the file by its full file path, or set \lstinline=$PATH=
appropriately yourself (this could be done via
\lstinline=$HOME/.profile=, which is sourced at the top of the task job
script, or in the suite definition itself).

Note the use of \lstinline=set -e= above to make the script abort on
error. This allows the error trapping code in the task job script to
automatically detect unforeseen errors.

\subsection{Cycling Tasks}

\hilight{ suite: \lstinline=tut.cycling.one= }
\vspace{3mm}

So far we've considered non-cycling tasks, which finish without spawning
a successor. Cycling tasks have an associated cycle time, and they spawn
a successor at their next cycle time as soon as they are submitted to
run (so that successive instances of a task can run in parallel if
the opportunity arises and their dependencies allow it and).

Open the \lstinline=tut.cycling.one= suite:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\lstinputlisting{../examples/tutorial/cycling/one/suite.rc}
The difference between cycling and non-cycling suites is all in the
\lstinline=[scheduling]= section, so we will leave the
\lstinline=[runtime]= section alone for now (this will result in
cycling dummy tasks).  Note that the graph is now defined under an
{\em Hours Of The Day} cycling section - each task in the graph section
will have a succession of cycle times of ending in $00$ or $12$ hours,
between specified initial and final cycle times (or indefinitely, if no
final cycle time is given), as shown in Figure~\ref{fig-tut-one}.

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{graphics/png/orig/tut-one.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption{The \lstinline=tut.cycling.one= suite}
\label{fig-tut-one}
\end{figure}

\lstset{language=transcript}
If you run this suite instances of \lstinline=foo= will spawn in
parallel out to the {\em suite runahead limit}, and each \lstinline=bar=
will trigger off the corresponding instance of \lstinline=foo= at the
same cycle time.  The runahead limit prevents uncontrolled spawning of
cycling tasks in suites that are not constrained by clock triggers in
real time operation.  The default limit is twice the shortest cycling
interval in the suite.

Experiment with \lstinline=tut.cycling.one= to see how cycling tasks
work.

\begin{myitemize}
    \item The suite runahead limit is configurable - see
        Section~\ref{RunaheadLimit}.
    \item Stepped daily, monthly, and yearly cycling is also supported -
    see Section~\ref{OtherCyclingModules}.
\end{myitemize}

\subsubsection{Inter-Cycle Triggers}
\label{TutIntercycleTriggers}

\hilight{ suite: \lstinline=tut.cycling.two= }
\vspace{3mm}

The \lstinline=tut.cycling.two= suite adds inter-cycle dependence
to the previous example:
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[0,12]]]
            graph = "foo[T-12] => foo => bar"
\end{lstlisting}
For any given cycle time \lstinline=T= in the sequence defined by the
cycling graph section heading, \lstinline=bar= triggers off
\lstinline=foo= as before, but now \lstinline=foo= triggers off its own
previous instance \lstinline=foo[T-12]=. Figure~\ref{fig-tut-two} shows
how this connects the cycling graph sections together.
\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{graphics/png/orig/tut-two.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption{The \lstinline=tut.cycling.two= suite}
\label{fig-tut-two}
\end{figure}

Experiment with this suite to see how inter-cycle triggers work.
Note that the first instance of \lstinline=foo=, at suite start-up, will
trigger immediately in spite of its inter-cycle trigger, because cylc
ignores triggers that reach back beyond the initial cycle time.

The presence of an inter-cycle trigger usually implies something
special has to happen at start-up, however. If a model depends on its
own previous instance for restart files, for instance, then some special
process will typically have to
generate the initial set of restart files when there is no previous
cycle to do it.  The following sections illustrate several ways of
handling this in cylc suites.

\subsubsection{Initial Asynchronous Tasks}

\hilight{ suite: \lstinline=tut.cycling.three= }
\vspace{3mm}

{\em Asynchronous} tasks are non-cycling tasks with no associated
cycle time, as in \lstinline=tut.cycling.three=:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = "prep"
        [[[0,12]]]
            graph = "prep & foo[T-12] => foo => bar"
\end{lstlisting}
This is shown in on the left of Figure~\ref{fig-tut-three}.

\lstset{language=transcript}
Initially \lstinline=foo[T-12]= will be ignored because its cycle time
is earlier than the suite's initial cycle time. In subsequent cycles
dependence on the asynchronous task will be ignored and \lstinline=foo=
will trigger off its previous instance.

\subsubsection{Initial Start-up Tasks}

\hilight{ suite: \lstinline=tut.cycling.four= }
\vspace{3mm}

An alternative to an asynchronous task is a {\em start-up} task, which
is a non-cycling task that nevertheless has an associated cycle time, as
in \lstinline=tut.cycling.four=:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[special tasks]]
        start-up = prep
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[0,12]]]
            graph = "prep & foo[T-12] => foo => bar"
\end{lstlisting}
This is shown in the right of Figure~\ref{fig-tut-three}.
\lstset{language=transcript}
Initially \lstinline=foo[T-12]= will be ignored because its cycle time
is earlier than the suite's initial cycle time. In subsequent cycles
dependence on the start-up task will be ignored and \lstinline=foo= will
trigger off its previous instance.

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{graphics/png/orig/tut-three.png}
        \hspace{20mm}
        \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{graphics/png/orig/tut-four.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption{The \lstinline=tut.cycling.three= and
    \lstinline=tut.cycling.four= suites}
\label{fig-tut-three}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Initial Cold-start Tasks}

\hilight{ suite: \lstinline=tut.cycling.five= }
\vspace{3mm}

Special one-off {\em cold-start} tasks provide another way to handle
inter-cycle dependence at start-up, illustrated by
\lstinline=tut.cycling.five=.
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[special tasks]]
        cold-start = cfoo
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[0,12]]]
            graph = "cfoo | foo[T-6] => foo => bar"
\end{lstlisting}

For any given cycle time a warm-cycled model can in principle trigger
off a previous instance of itself {\em or} off a special cold start
process that generates the same result, technically, in terms of restart
files for the model. Cold-start tasks in cylc are intended to closely
mirror this real process. Cylc somewhat arbitrarily assigns the
cold-start task the same cycle time as the associated model, but a cycle
time offset can be computed by the task itself if necessary.

The conditional OR trigger means this does not actually rely on
cylc ignoring triggers that reach back beyond the initial cycle time.
It also means dependence on the cold-start task can be retained
in subsequent cycles without stalling the suite, and consequently
cold-start tasks can be inserted later (\lstinline=cylc insert --help=)
to restart a model in-suite after a failure that requires missing one
or more cycles. Conversely, because cylc now ignores pre-initial-cycle
triggers, the cold-start OR construct is no longer necessary to bootstrap
a suite with inter-cycle triggers into action - you can use the
arguably simpler start-up tasks as described above.

Real suites may need a number of inter-dependent cold-start, start-up,
or asynchronous tasks at start-up.


\subsection{Jinja2}

Cylc has built in support for the Jinja2 template processor, which
allows us to embed code in suite definitions to generate the
final result seen by cylc.

The \lstinline=tut.oneoff.jinja2= suite illustrates two common
uses of Jinja2: changing suite content or structure based on the value
of a logical switch; and iteratively generating dependencies and runtime
configuration for groups of related tasks:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\lstinputlisting{../examples/tutorial/oneoff/jinja2/suite.rc}

To view the result of Jinja2 processing with the Jinja2 flag
\lstinline@MULTI@ set to \lstinline=False=:
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc view --jinja2 --stdout tut.oneoff.jinja2
\end{lstlisting}
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
title = "A Jinja2 Hello World! suite"
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = "hello"
[runtime]
    [[hello]]
        command scripting = "sleep 10; echo Hello World!"
\end{lstlisting}

And with \lstinline=MULTI= set to \lstinline=True=:
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc view --jinja2 --stdout tut.oneoff.jinja2
\end{lstlisting}
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
title = "A Jinja2 Hello World! suite"
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = "hello => BYE"
[runtime]
    [[hello]]
        command scripting = "sleep 10; echo Hello World!"
    [[BYE]]
        command scripting = "sleep 10; echo Goodbye World!"
    [[ goodbye_0 ]]
        inherit = BYE
    [[ goodbye_1 ]]
        inherit = BYE
    [[ goodbye_2 ]]
        inherit = BYE
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Task Retry On Failure}

\hilight{ suite: \lstinline=tut.oneoff.retry= }
\vspace{3mm}

Tasks can be configured to retry a number of times if they fail.
An environment variable \lstinline=$CYLC_TASK_TRY_NUBMER= increments
from $1$ on each successive try, and is passed to the task to allow
different behaviour on the retry:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\lstinputlisting{../examples/tutorial/oneoff/retry/suite.rc}

When a task with configured retries fails, its cylc task proxy goes
into the {\em retrying} state until the next retry delay is up, then it
resubmits.  It only enters the {\em failed} state on a final definitive
failure.

Experiment with \lstinline=tut.oneoff.retry= to see how this works.

\subsection{Other Users' Suites}

If you have read access to another user's account (even on another host)
it is possible to use \lstinline=cylc monitor= to look at their suite's
progress without full shell access to their account. To do this, you
will need to copy their suite passphrase to
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
    $HOME/.cylc/SUITE_HOST/SUITE_OWNER/SUITE_NAME/passphrase
\end{lstlisting}
(use of the host and owner names is optional here -
Section~\ref{passphrases}) {\em and} also retrieve the port number
of the running suite, which can be found in their account:
\begin{lstlisting}
    ~SUITE_OWNER/.cylc/ports/SUITE_NAME
\end{lstlisting}
Once you have this information, you can run
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc monitor --user=SUITE_OWNER --port=SUITE_PORT SUITE_NAME
\end{lstlisting}
to view the progress of their suite.

Other suite-connecting commands work in the same way too; see
Section~\ref{RemoteControl}.



\subsection{Searching A Suite}

The cylc suite search tool reports pattern matches in the suite definition
by line number, suite section, and file, even if the suite uses nested
include-files, and by file and line number for matches in suite bin
scripts:
\lstset{language=transcript}

\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc search examples/admin/suite.rc OUTPUT_DIR

FILE: /home/hilary/cylc/examples/admin/suite.rc
   SECTION: [runtime]->[[root]]->[[[environment]]]
      (52):             OUTPUT_DIR = $WORKSPACE

FILE: /home/hilary/cylc/examples/admin/bin/A.sh
   (7): cylc checkvars -c OUTPUT_DIR RUNNING_DIR
   (28): touch $OUTPUT_DIR/surface-winds-${CYLC_TASK_CYCLE_TIME}.nc
   (29): touch $OUTPUT_DIR/precipitation-${CYLC_TASK_CYCLE_TIME}.nc

#...
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Other Things To Try}

Almost every feature of cylc can be tested quickly and easily with a
simple dummy suite. You can write your own, or start from one of the
example suites in \lstinline=/path/to/cylc/examples= (see use of
\lstinline=cylc import-examples= above) - they all run ``out the box''
and can be copied and modified at will.

\begin{myitemize}

\item Change the suite runahead limit in a cycling suite.

\item Stop a suite mid-run with \lstinline=cylc stop=, and restart
it again with \lstinline=cylc restart=.

\item Hold (pause) a suite mid-run with \lstinline=cylc hold=,
    then modify the suite definition and \lstinline=cylc reload= it
    before using \lstinline=cylc release= to continue (you can also
    reload without holding).

\item Use the gcylc View menu to show the task state color key and
watch tasks in the \lstinline=task-states= example evolve
as the suite runs.

\item Manually re-run a task that has already completed or failed,
    with \lstinline=cylc trigger=.

\item Use an {\em internal queue} to prevent more than an alotted number
    of tasks from running at once even though they are ready -
   Section~\ref{InternalQueues}.

\item Configure task event hooks to send an email, or shut the suite down,
    on task failure.

\end{myitemize}


\section{Suite Name Registration And Passphrases}
\label{SuiteRegistration}

Cylc commands target suites via names registered in a {\em suite name
database} located at \lstinline=$HOME/.cylc/REGDB/=.  Suite names are
hierarchical like directory paths, allowing nested tree-like grouping,
but use the `.' character as a delimiter. This :
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc db print -t nwp
nwp
 |-oper
 | |-region1  Local Model Region1       /oper/nwp/suites/LocalModel/nested/Region1
 | `-region2  Local Model Region2       /oper/nwp/suites/LocalModel/nested/Region2
 `-test
   `-region1  Local Model TEST Region1  /home/hilary/suites/Regional/TESTS/Region1
\end{lstlisting}

Suite titles held in the name database are parsed from the suite
definition at the time of initial suite registration. If you change the
title later use \lstinline=cylc db refresh= to update the database.

Name groups are entirely virtual, they do not need to be
explicitly created before use, and they automatically disappear if all
tasks are removed from them.  From the listing above, for example, to
move the suite \lstinline=nwp.oper.region2= into the
\lstinline=nwp.test= group:
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc db rereg nwp.oper.region2 nwp.test.region2
REREGISTER nwp.oper.region2 to nwp.test.region2
shell$ cylc db print -tx nwp
nwp
 |-oper
 | `-region1  Local Model Region1
 `-test
   |-region1  Local Model TEST Region1
   `-region2  Local Model Region2
\end{lstlisting}
And to move \lstinline=nwp.test.region2= into a new group \lstinline=nwp.para=:
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc db rereg nwp.test.region2 nwp.para.region2
REREGISTER nwp.test.region2 to nwp.para.region2
shell$ cylc db print -tx nwp
nwp
 |-oper
 | `-region1  Local Model Region1
 |-test
 | `-region1  Local Model TEST Region1
 `-para
   `-region2  Local Model Region2
\end{lstlisting}

Currently you cannot explicitly indicate a group name on the command
line by appending a dot character. Rather, in database operations such
as copy, reregister, or unregister, the identity of the source item
(group or suite) is inferred from the content of the database; and if
the source item is a group, so must the target be a group (or it will
be, in the case of an item that will be created by the operation). This
means that you cannot copy a single suite into a group that does not
exist yet unless you specify the entire target suite name.

\lstinline=cylc db register --help= shows a number of other examples.

\subsection{Database Operations}

On the command line, the  `database' (or `db') command category contains
commands to implement the aforementioned operations.

\lstset{language=usage}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc db help
CATEGORY: db|database - Suite name registration, copying, deletion, etc.

Suite name registrations are held in a simple database $HOME/.cylc/REGDB
shell$ cat $HOME/.cylc/REGDB/my.suite
   title=my suite title
   path=/path/to/my/suite

HELP: cylc [db|database] COMMAND help,--help
  You can abbreviate db|database and COMMAND.
  The category db|database may be omitted.

COMMANDS:
  copy|cp ............. Copy a suite or a group of suites
  get-directory ....... Retrieve suite definition directory paths
  print ............... Print registered suites
  refresh ............. Report invalid registrations and update suite titles
  register ............ Register a suite for use
  reregister|rename ... Change the name of a suite
  unregister .......... Unregister and optionally delete suites
\end{lstlisting}

Groups of suites (at any level in the name hierarchy) can be deleted,
copied, imported, and exported; as well as individual suites.  To do this,
just use suite group names as source and/or target for operations, as
appropriate.  For instance, if a group \lstinline=foo.bar= contains the
suites \lstinline=foo.bar.baz= and \lstinline=foo.bar.qux=, you can copy
a single suite like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc copy foo.bar.baz boo $HOME/suites
\end{lstlisting}
(resulting in a new suite \lstinline=boo=); or the group like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc copy foo.bar boo $HOME/suites
\end{lstlisting}
(resulting in new suites \lstinline=boo.baz= and \lstinline=boo.qux=); or the group like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc copy foo boo $HOME/suites
\end{lstlisting}
(resulting in new suites \lstinline=boo.bar.baz= and \lstinline=boo.bar.qux=).
When suites are copied, the suite definition directories are copied into
a directory tree, under the target directory, that reflects the
suite name hierarchy. \lstinline=cylc copy --help= has some explicit examples.

The same functionality is also available by right-clicking on suites
or groups in the gcylc ``Open Registered Suite'' dialog.

\subsection{Suite Passphrases}

Any client process that connects to a running suite (this includes task
messaging and user-invoked interrogation and control commands) must
authenticate with a secure passphrase that has been loaded by the suite.
A random passphrase is generated automatically in the suite definition
directory at registration time if one does not already exist there. For
the default Pyro-based connection method the passphrase file must be
distributed to other accounts that host running tasks or from which
you need monitoring or control access to the running suite.

Alternatively, cylc can be configured to,
\begin{myenumerate}
\item use ssh to re-invoke task messaging commands on the suite host; or
\item use a one-way polling mechanism for tracking task progress.
\end{myenumerate}
Neither of these methods require the suite passphrase to be installed
on the task host. For ssh re-invocation ssh keys must be installed for
the task-to-suite direction in addition to the suite-to-task setup
already required for job submission. The automatic polling mechanism can
be used as a last resort for hosts that do not allow routing back to the
suite host for pyro or ssh. It can also be used as regular health check
on submitted tasks under the other communications methods.

See Section~\ref{RunningSuites} for more detail on cylc client/server
communications, and how to use it.

\section{Suite Definition}
\label{SuiteDefinition}

Cylc suites are defined in structured, validated, {\em suite.rc} files
that concisely specify the properties of, and the relationships
between, the various tasks managed by the suite. This section of the
User Guide deals with the format and content of the suite.rc file,
including task definition. Task implementation - what's required of the
real commands, scripts, or programs that do the processing that the
tasks represent - is covered in Section~\ref{TaskImplementation}; and
task job submission - how tasks are submitted to run - is in
Section~\ref{TaskJobSubmission}.

\subsection{Suite Definition Directories}
\label{SuiteDefinitionDirectories}

A cylc {\em suite definition directory} contains:
\begin{myitemize}
    \item {\bf A suite.rc file}: this is the suite definition.
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item And any include-files used in it (see below; may be
                kept in sub-directories).
        \end{myitemize}
    \item {\bf A \lstinline=bin/= sub-directory}.
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item {\em Optional.}
            \item For scripts and executables that implement, or are
                used by, suite tasks.
            \item Automatically added to \lstinline=$PATH= in task
                execution environments.
            \item Alternatively, tasks can call external
                commands, scripts, or programs; or they can be scripted
                entirely within the suite.rc file.
        \end{myitemize}
    \item {\bf A \lstinline=python/= sub-directory}.
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item {\em Optional.}
            \item For user-defined job-submission methods, if needed (see
                Section~\ref{TaskJobSubmission}).
            \item Alternatively, new job submission methods can be
                installed into the cylc source tree, or in any directory
                in your \lstinline=$PYTHONPATH=.
        \end{myitemize}
    \item {\bf Any other sub-directories and files} - documentation,
        control files, etc.
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item {\em Optional.}
            \item Holding everything in one place makes proper suite
                revision control possible.
            \item Portable access to files here, for running tasks, is
                provided through
                \lstinline=$CYLC_SUITE_DEF_PATH=
                (see Section~\ref{TaskExecutionEnvironment}).
            \item Ignored by cylc, but the entire suite definition
                directory tree is copied when you copy a
                suite using cylc commands.

        \end{myitemize}
\end{myitemize}
A typical example:
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
/path/to/my/suite   # suite definition directory
    suite.rc           # THE SUITE DEFINITION FILE
    bin/               # scripts and executables used by tasks
        foo.sh
        bar.sh
        ...
    # (OPTIONAL) any other suite-related files, for example:
    inc/               # suite.rc include-files
        nwp-tasks.rc
        globals.rc
        ...
    doc/               # documentation
    control/           # control files
    ancil/             # ancillary files
    ...
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Suite.rc File Overview}
\label{SuiteRCFile}

Suite.rc files are an extended-INI format with section nesting.

Embedded template processor expressions may also be used in the file, to
programatically generate the final suite definition seen by
cylc.  Currently the Jinja2 template processor is supported
(\url{http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs}); see {\em Jinja2}
(Section~\ref{Jinja2}) for examples. In the future cylc may provide a
plug-in interface to allow use of other template engines too.

\subsubsection{Syntax}
\label{Syntax}

The following defines legal suite.rc syntax:
\begin{myitemize}
    \item {\bf Items} are of the form \lstinline@item = value@.
    \item {\bf [Section]} headings are enclosed in square brackets.
    \item {\bf Sub-section [[nesting]]} is defined by repeated square brackets.
    \item Sections are {\bf closed} by the next section heading.
    \item {\bf Comments} (line and trailing) follow a hash character: \#
    \item {\bf List values} are comma-separated.
    \item {\bf Single-line string values} can be single-, double-, or un-quoted.
    \item {\bf Multi-line string values} are triple-quoted (using
        single or double quote characters).
    \item {\bf Boolean values} are capitalized: True, False.
    \item {\bf Leading and trailing whitespace} is ignored.
    \item {\bf Indentation} is optional but should be used for clarity.
    \item {\bf Continuation lines} follow a trailing backslash: \textbackslash
    \item {\bf Duplicate sections} add their items to those previously
        defined under the same section.
    \item {\bf Duplicate items} override, {\em except for dependency
        \lstinline=graph= strings, which are additive}.
    \item {\bf Include-files} \lstinline=%include inc/foo.rc= can be
        used as a verbatim inlining mechanism.
\end{myitemize}
Suites that embed Jinja2 code (Section~\ref{Jinja2}) must
process to raw suite.rc syntax.

\subsubsection{Include-Files}

Cylc has native support for suite.rc include-files, which may help to
organize large suites. Inclusion boundaries are completely arbitrary -
you can think of include-files as chunks of the suite.rc file simply
cut-and-pasted into another file.  Include-files may be included
multiple times in the same file, and even nested.  Include-file paths
can be specified portably relative to the suite definition directory,
e.g.:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
# include the file $CYLC_SUITE_DEF_PATH/inc/foo.rc:
%include inc/foo.rc
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Editing Temporarily Inlined Suites}

Cylc's native file inclusion mechanism supports optional inlined
editing:
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc edit --inline SUITE
\end{lstlisting}
The suite will be split back into its constituent include-files when you
exit the edit session. While editing, the inlined file becomes the
official suite definition so that changes take effect whenever you save
the file.  See \lstinline=cylc prep edit --help= for more information.

\paragraph{Include-Files via Jinja2}

Jinja2 (Section~\ref{Jinja2}) also has template inclusion functionality.

\subsubsection{Syntax Highlighting For Suite Definitions}
\label{SyntaxHighlighting}

\lstset{language=transcript}
Cylc comes with a syntax file to configure suite.rc syntax
highlighting and section folding in the {\em vim} editor, as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig-cylc-vim}. We also have an {\em emacs} font-lock mode,
and syntax files for the {\em gedit} and {\em kate} editors:
\begin{lstlisting}
$CYLC_DIR/conf/cylc.vim     # vim
$CYLC_DIR/conf/cylc-mode.el # emacs
$CYLC_DIR/conf/cylc.lang    # gedit (and other gtksourceview programs)
$CYLC_DIR/conf/cylc.xml     # kate
\end{lstlisting}
Refer to comments at the top of each file to see how to use them.

\subsubsection{Gross File Structure}

Cylc suite.rc files consist of a suite title and description followed by
configuration items grouped under several top level section headings:

\begin{myitemize}
    \item {\bf [cylc] } - {\em non task-specific suite configuration}
    \item {\bf [scheduling] } - {\em determines when tasks are ready to run}
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item tasks with special behaviour, e.g. clock-triggered tasks
            \item the dependency graph, which defines the relationships
                between tasks
        \end{myitemize}
    \item {\bf [runtime] } - {\em determines how, where, and what to
        execute when tasks are ready}
        \begin{myitemize}
            \item command scripting, environment, job submission, remote
                hosting, etc.
            \item suite-wide defaults in the {\em root} namespace
            \item a nested family hierarchy with common properties
                inherited by related tasks
        \end{myitemize}
    \item {\bf [visualization] } - suite graph styling
\end{myitemize}


\subsubsection{Validation}
\label{Validation}

Cylc suite.rc files are automatically validated against a specification
that defines all legal entries, values, options, and defaults. This
detects formatting errors, typographic errors, illegal items and illegal
values prior to run time. Some values are complex strings that require
further parsing by cylc to determine their correctness (this is also
done during validation). All legal entries are documented in the {\em
Suite.rc Reference} (Appendix~\ref{SuiteRCReference}).

The validator reports the line numbers of detected errors. Here's an
example showing a section heading with a missing right bracket:
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc validate my.suite
    [[special tasks]
'Section bracket mismatch, line 19'
\end{lstlisting}

If the suite.rc file uses include-files \lstinline=cylc view= will
show an inlined copy of the suite with correct line numbers
(you can also edit suites in a temporarily inlined state with
\lstinline=cylc edit --inline=).

Validation does not check the validity of chosen job submission methods.
%this is to allow users to extend cylc with their own job submission
%methods, which are by definition unknown to the suite.rc spec.

\subsection{Scheduling - Dependency Graphs}
\label{ConfiguringScheduling}

\lstset{language=suiterc}
The \lstinline=[scheduling]= section of a suite.rc file defines the
relationships between tasks in a suite - the information that allows
cylc to determine when tasks are ready to run. The most important
component of this is the suite dependency graph. Cylc graph notation
makes clear textual graph representations that are very concise because
sections of the graph that repeat at different hours of the day, say,
only have to be defined once.  Here's an example with dependencies that
vary depending on cycle time:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[0,6,12,18]]] # validity (hours of the day)
            graph = """
A => B & C   # B and C trigger off A
A[T-6] => A  # Model A restart trigger
                    """
        [[[6,18]]]
            graph = "C => X"
\end{lstlisting}
\lstset{language=transcript}
Figure~\ref{fig-dep-eg-1} shows the complete suite.rc listing alongside
the suite graph.
This is a complete, valid, runnable suite (it will use default
task runtime properties such as command scripting).

\begin{figure}
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.5\textwidth}
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
title = "Dependency Graph Example"
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[0,6,12,18]]] # validity (hours)
            graph = """
A => B & C   # B and C trigger off A
A[T-6] => A  # Model A restart trigger
                    """
        [[[6,18]]] # hours
            graph = "C => X"
[visualization]
    [[node attributes]]
        X = "color=red"
\end{lstlisting}
\lstset{language=transcript}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.5\textwidth}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{graphics/png/orig/dep-eg-1.png}
    \end{center}
\end{minipage}
\caption[Example Suite]{\scriptsize Example Suite}
\label{fig-dep-eg-1}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Graph String Syntax}

Multiline graph strings may contain:
\begin{myitemize}
    \item {\bf blank lines}
    \item {\bf arbitrary white space}
    \item {\bf internal comments:} following the \lstinline=#= character
    \item {\bf conditional task trigger expressions} - see below.
\end{myitemize}

\subsubsection{Interpreting Graph Strings}

Suite dependency graphs can be broken down into pairs in which the left
side (which may be a single task or family, or several that are
conditionally related) defines a trigger for the task or family on the
right. For instance the ``word graph'' {\em C triggers off B which
triggers off A} can be deconstructed into pairs {\em C triggers off B}
and {\em B triggers off A}.  In this section we use only the default
trigger type, which is to trigger off the upstream task succeeding; see
Section~\ref{TriggerTypes} for other available triggers.

In the case of cycling tasks, the triggers defined by a graph string are
valid for cycle times matching the list of hours specified for the
graph section. For example this graph,
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[0,12]]]
            graph = "A => B"
\end{lstlisting}
\lstset{language=transcript}
implies that B triggers off A for cycle times in which the hour matches
$0$ or $12$.

To define intercycle dependencies, attach an offset indicator to the
left side of a pair:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[0,12]]]
            graph = "A[T-12] => B"
\end{lstlisting}
\lstset{language=transcript}
This means B[T] triggers off A[T-12] for cycle times T with hours
matching $0$ or $12$. T must be implicit unless there is a cycle time
offset - this keeps graphs clean and concise because the majority of
tasks will typically depend only on others with the same cycle time.
Cycle time offsets can only appear on the left of a pair, because a
pairs define triggers for the right task at cycle time T.  However,
\lstinline@A => B[T-6]@, which is illegal, can be reformulated as a
{\em future trigger} \lstinline@A[T+6] => B@ (see
Section~\ref{IntercycleTriggers}).

Triggers can be chained together. This graph:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
    graph = """A => B  # B triggers off A
               B => C  # C triggers off B"""
\end{lstlisting}
is equivalent to this:
\begin{lstlisting}
    graph = "A => B => C"
\end{lstlisting}

{\em Each trigger in the graph must be unique} but {\em the same task
can appear in multiple pairs or chains}. Separately defined triggers
for the same task have an AND relationship. So this:
\begin{lstlisting}
    graph = """A => X  # X triggers off A
               B => X  # X also triggers off B"""
\end{lstlisting}
is equivalent to this:
\begin{lstlisting}
    graph = "A & B => X"  # X triggers off A AND B
\end{lstlisting}

In summary, the branching tree structure of a dependency graph can
be partitioned into lines (in the suite.rc graph string) of pairs
or chains, in any way you like, with liberal use of internal white space
and comments to make the graph structure as clear as possible.

\begin{lstlisting}
# B triggers if A succeeds, then C and D trigger if B succeeds:
    graph = "A => B => C & D"
# which is equivalent to this:
    graph = """A => B => C
               B => D"""
# and to this:
    graph = """A => B => D
               B => C"""
# and to this:
    graph = """A => B
               B => C
               B => D"""
# and it can even be written like this:
    graph = """A => B # blank line follows:

               B => C # comment ...
               B => D"""
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Handling Long Graph Lines}

Long chains of dependencies can be split into pairs:
\begin{lstlisting}
    graph = "A => B => C"
# is equivalent to this:
    graph = """A => B
               B => C"""
# BUT THIS IS AN ERROR:
    graph = """A => B => # WRONG!
               C"""      # WRONG!
\end{lstlisting}
If you have very long task names, or long conditional trigger
expressions (below) then you can use the suite.rc line continuation
marker:
\begin{lstlisting}
    graph = "A => B \
    => C"  # OK
\end{lstlisting}
Note that a line continuation marker must be the final character on
the line; it cannot be followed by trailing spaces or a comment.

\lstset{language=transcript}

\subsubsection{Graph Types (VALIDITY)}
\label{GraphTypes}

A suite definition can contain multiple graph strings that are combined
to generate the final graph. There are different graph VALIDITY section
headings for cycling, one-off asynchronous, and repeating asynchronous
tasks. Additionally, there may be multiple graph strings under different
VALIDITY sections for cycling tasks with different dependencies at
different cycle times.

\paragraph{One-off Asynchronous Tasks}

Figure~\ref{fig-test1} shows a small suite of one-off asynchronous
tasks; these have no associated cycle time and don't spawn successors
(once they're all finished the suite just exits).  The integer $1$
attached to each graph node is just an arbitrary label, akin to the task
cycle time in cycling tasks; it increments when a repeating asynchronous
task (below) spawns.
\begin{figure}
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.5\textwidth}
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
title = some one-off asynchronous tasks
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = "foo => bar & baz => qux"
\end{lstlisting}
\lstset{language=transcript}
\end{minipage}
\hfill

    \end{center}
\end{minipage}
\caption[One-off Asynchronous Tasks]{\scriptsize One-off Asynchronous Tasks.}
\label{fig-test1}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Cycling Tasks}

For cycling tasks the graph VALIDITY section heading defines a sequence of
cycles times for which the subsequent graph section is valid.
Figure~\ref{fig-test2} shows a small suite of cycling tasks.
\begin{figure}
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.5\textwidth}
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
title = some cycling tasks
# (no dependence between cycles here)
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[0,12]]]
            graph = "foo => bar & baz => qux"
\end{lstlisting}
\lstset{language=transcript}

\subparagraph{Stepped Daily, Monthly, And Yearly Cycling}
\label{OtherCyclingModules}

In addition to the original hours-of-the-day section headings, cylc now
has an extensible cycling mechanism and (so far) stepped daily, monthly,
and yearly cycling modules:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[Daily(20100809,2)]]]
            graph = "foo => bar"
        [[[Monthly(201008,2)]]]
            graph = "cat[T-2] => dog"
        [[[Yearly(2010,2)]]]
            graph = "apple => orange"
\end{lstlisting}
The section heading arguments here are an {\em anchor} datetime and an
integer {\em step}. The cycle sequence always passes through the anchor
regardless of the suite's initial cycle time. So, for example,
\lstinline=Yearly(2010,3)= defines a 3-yearly sequence that always lands
on the year 2010, not 2011 or 2012, regardless of the initial cycle time
- which can be before or after 2010.

Note that hours-of-the-day graph section headings can also be written
to explicitly reference the associated cycling module:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[HoursOfTheDay(0,6,12,18)]]] # same as [[[0,6,12,18]]]
            graph = "red => blue"
\end{lstlisting}

\subparagraph{How Multiple Graph Strings Combine}
\label{HowMultipleGraphStringsCombine}

For a cycling graph with multiple validity sections for different
hours of the day, the different sections {\em add} to generate the
complete graph. Different graph sections can overlap (i.e.\ the same
hours may appear in multiple section headings) and the same tasks may
appear in multiple sections, but individual dependencies should be
unique across the entire graph. For example, the following graph defines
a duplicate prerequisite for task C:
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[0,6,12,18]]]
            graph = "A => B => C"
        [[[6,18]]]
            graph = "B => C => X"
            # duplicate prerequisite: B => C already defined at 6, 18
\end{lstlisting}
This does not affect scheduling, but for the sake of clarity and brevity
the graph should be written like this:
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[0,6,12,18]]]
            graph = "A => B => C"
        [[[6,18]]]
            # X triggers off C only at 6 and 18 hours
            graph = "C => X"
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Combined Asynchronous And Synchronous Graphs}

Cycling tasks can be made to wait on one-off asynchronous tasks, as
shown in Figure~\ref{fig-test4}. Alternatively, they can be made to wait
on one-off synchronous start-up tasks, which have an associated cycle
time even though they are non-cycling - see Figure~\ref{fig-test5}.

\subparagraph{Synchronous Start-up vs One-off Asynchronous Tasks}

One-off synchronous start-up tasks run only when a cycling suite is
{\em cold-started} and they are often associated with subsequent one-off
{\em cold-start tasks} used to bootstrap a cycling suite into existence.

The distinction between cold- and warm-start is only meaningful for
cycling tasks, and one-off asynchronous tasks may be best used in
constructing entirely non-cycling suites.

However, one-off asynchronous tasks can precede cycling tasks in the
same suite, as shown above. It seems likely that, if used in this way,
they will be intended as start-up tasks - so currently {\em one-off
asynchronous tasks only run in a cold-start}.

\paragraph{Repeating Asynchronous Tasks}

Repeating asynchronous tasks can be used, for example, to process
satellite data that arrives at irregular time intervals. Each new
dataset must have a unique ``asynchronous ID''. If it doesn't naturally
have such an ID a string representation of the data arrival time could
be used.  The graph VALIDITY section heading must contain ``ASYNCID:''
followed by a regular expression that matches the actual IDs.
Additionally, one task in the suite must be a designated ``daemon''
that waits indefinitely on incoming data and reports each new dataset
(and its ID) back to the suite by means of a special output message.
When the daemon task proxy receives a matching message it dynamically
registers a new output (containing the ID) that downstream tasks can
then trigger off. The downstream tasks likewise have prerequisites
containing the ID pattern (because they trigger off the aforementioned
outputs) and when these get satisfied during dependency negotiation the
actual ID is substituted into their own registered outputs.
Finally, each asynchronous repeating task proxy passes the ID to its
task execution environment as
\lstinline=$ASYNCID= to allow identification of the correct dataset by
task scripts.
In this way a tree of tasks becomes dedicated to processing each
new dataset, and multiple datasets can be processed in parallel if
they become available in quick succession. As Figure~\ref{fig-test3}
shows, a repeating asynchronous suite currently plots just like a
one-off asynchronous suite. But at run time the daemon task stays put,
while the others continually spawn successors to wait for new datasets
to come in. The {\em asynchronous.repeating} example suite demonstrates
how to do this in a real suite. {\em Note that other trigger types
(success, failure, start, suicide, and conditional) cannot currently be
used in a repeating asynchronous graph section.}

\subsubsection{Trigger Types}
\label{TriggerTypes}

\lstset{language=suiterc}

Trigger type, indicated by {\em:type} after the upstream task (or family)
name, determines what kind of event results in the downstream task (or
family) triggering.

\paragraph{Success Triggers}

The default, with no trigger type specified, is to trigger off the
upstream task succeeding:
\begin{lstlisting}
# B triggers if A SUCCEEDS:
    graph = "A => B"
\end{lstlisting}
For consistency and completeness, however, the success trigger can be explicit:
\begin{lstlisting}
# B triggers if A SUCCEEDS:
    graph = "A => B"
# or:
    graph = "A:succeed => B"
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Failure Triggers}

To trigger off the upstream task reporting failure:
\begin{lstlisting}
# B triggers if A FAILS:
    graph = "A:fail => B"
\end{lstlisting}
Section~\ref{SuicideTriggers} ({\em Suicide Triggers}) shows
one way of handling task B here if A does not fail.

\paragraph{Start Triggers}

To trigger off the upstream task starting to execute:
\begin{lstlisting}
# B triggers if A STARTS EXECUTING:
    graph = "A:start => B"
\end{lstlisting}
This can be used to trigger tasks that monitor other tasks once they
(the target tasks) start executing. Consider a long-running forecast model,
for instance, that generates a sequence of output files as it runs. A
postprocessing task could be launched with a start trigger on the model
(\lstinline@model:start => post@) to process the model output as it
becomes available. Note, however, that there are several alternative
ways of handling this scenario: both tasks could be triggered at the
same time (\lstinline@foo => model & post@), but depending on
external queue delays this could result in the monitoring task starting
to execute first; or a different postprocessing task could be
triggered off an internal output for each data file
(\lstinline@model:out1 => post1@ etc.; see
Section~\ref{InternalTriggers}), but this may not be practical if the
number of output files is large or if it is difficult to add cylc
messaging calls to the model.

\paragraph{Finish Triggers}

To trigger off the upstream task succeeding or failing, i.e.\ finishing
one way or the other:
\begin{lstlisting}
# B triggers if A either SUCCEEDS or FAILS:
    graph = "A | A:fail => B"
# or
    graph = "A:finish => B"
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Internal (Message) Triggers}
\label{InternalTriggers}

These allow triggering off off events that occur while a task runs. A
special event message must be registered in the suite definition, and
deliberately sent by the task at the appropriate time.
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[6,18]]]
            # B triggers off internal output "upload1" of task A:
            graph = "A:upload1 => B"
[runtime]
    [[A]]
        [[[outputs]]]
            upload1 = "NWP products uploaded for [T]"
\end{lstlisting}
Task A must emit this message when the actual output has been completed -
see {\em Reporting Internal Outputs Completed} (Section~\ref{RIOC}).

\paragraph{Job Submission Triggers}

It is also possible to trigger off a task submitting, or failing to submit:
\begin{lstlisting}
# B triggers if A submits successfully:
    graph = "A:submit => B"
# D triggers if C fails to submit successfully:
    graph = "C:submit-fail => D"
\end{lstlisting}

A possible use case for submit-fail triggers: if a task goes into the
submit-failed state, possibly after several job submission retries,
another task that inherits the same runtime but sets a different job
submission method and/or host could be triggered to, in effect, run the
same job on a different platform.


\paragraph{Conditional Triggers}

AND operators (\lstinline=&=) can appear on both sides of an arrow. They
provide a concise alternative to defining multiple triggers separately:
\begin{lstlisting}
# 1/ this:
    graph = "A & B => C"
# is equivalent to:
    graph = """A => C
               B => C"""
# 2/ this:
    graph = "A => B & C"
# is equivalent to:
    graph = """A => B
               A => C"""
# 3/ and this:
    graph = "A & B => C & D"
# is equivalent to this:
    graph = """A => C
               B => C
               A => D
               B => D"""
\end{lstlisting}

OR operators (\lstinline=|=) which result in true conditional triggers,
can only appear on the left,\footnote{An OR
operator on the right doesn't make much sense: if ``B or C'' triggers
off A, what exactly should cylc do when A finishes?}
\begin{lstlisting}
# C triggers when either A or B finishes:
    graph = "A | B => C"
\end{lstlisting}

Forecasting suites typically have simple conditional
triggering requirements, but any valid conditional expression can be
used, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig-conditional}
(conditional triggers are plotted with open arrow heads).
\begin{figure}
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.5\textwidth}
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
        graph = """
# D triggers if A or (B and C) succeed
A | B & C => D
# just to align the two graph sections
D => W
# Z triggers if (W or X) and Y succeed
(W|X) & Y => Z
                """
\end{lstlisting}
\lstset{language=transcript}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.5\textwidth}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{graphics/png/orig/conditional-triggers.png}
    \end{center}
\end{minipage}
\caption[Conditional Triggers] {\scriptsize
Conditional triggers are plotted with open arrow heads.}
\label{fig-conditional}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Suicide Triggers}
\label{SuicideTriggers}

Suicide triggers take tasks out of the suite. This can be used for
automated failure recovery. The suite.rc listing and accompanying
graph in Figure~\ref{fig-suicide} show how to define a chain of failure
recovery tasks
that trigger if they're needed but otherwise remove themselves from the
suite (you can run the {\em AutoRecover.async} example suite to see how
this works).  The dashed graph edges ending in solid dots indicate
suicide triggers, and the open arrowheads indicate conditional triggers
as usual.

\begin{figure}
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.5\textwidth}
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
title = asynchronous automated recovery
description = """
Model task failure triggers diagnosis
and recovery tasks, which take themselves
out of the suite if model succeeds. Model
post processing triggers off model OR
recovery tasks.
              """
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = """
pre => model
model:fail => diagnose => recover
model => !diagnose & !recover
model | recover => post
                """
[runtime]
    [[model]]
        # UNCOMMENT TO TEST FAILURE:
        # command scripting = /bin/false
\end{lstlisting}
\lstset{language=transcript}
\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}[b]{0.5\textwidth}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{graphics/png/orig/suicide.png}
    \end{center}
\end{minipage}
\caption[Automated failure recovery via suicide triggers] {\scriptsize
Automated failure recovery via suicide triggers.}
\label{fig-suicide}
\end{figure}

Note that multiple suicide triggers combine in the same way as other triggers, so this:
\begin{lstlisting}
foo => !baz
bar => !baz
\end{lstlisting}
is equivalent to this:
\begin{lstlisting}
foo & bar => !baz
\end{lstlisting}
i.e.\ both \lstinline=foo= and \lstinline=bar= must succeed for
\lstinline=baz= to be taken out of the suite. If you really want a task
to be taken out if any one of several events occurs then be careful to
write it that way:
\begin{lstlisting}
foo | bar => !baz
\end{lstlisting}

A word of warning on the meaning of ``bare suicide triggers''. Consider
the following suite:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = "foo => !bar"
\end{lstlisting}
Task \lstinline=bar= has a suicide trigger but no normal prerequisites
(a suicide trigger is not a task triggering prerequisite, it is a task
removal prerequisite) so this is entirely equivalent to:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = """
            foo & bar
           foo => !bar
                """
\end{lstlisting}
In other words both tasks will trigger immediately, at the same time,
and then \lstinline=bar= will be removed if \lstinline=foo= succeeds.

If an active task proxy (currently in the submitted or running states)
is removed from the suite by a suicide trigger, a warning will be logged.

\paragraph{Family Triggers}
\label{FamilyTriggers}

Families defined by the namespace inheritance hierarchy
(Section~\ref{NIORP}) can be used in the graph trigger whole groups of
tasks at the same time (e.g.\ forecast model ensembles and groups of
tasks for processing different observation types at the same time) and
for triggering downstream tasks off families as a whole. Higher level
families, i.e.  families of families, can also be used, and are reduced
to the lowest level member tasks. Note that tasks can also trigger off
individual family members if necessary.

To trigger an entire task family at once:
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = "foo => fam"
[runtime]
    [[fam]]    # a family (because others inherit from it)
    [[m1,m2]]  # family members (inherit from namespace fam)
        inherit = fam
\end{lstlisting}
This is equivalent to:
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = "foo => m1 & m2"
[runtime]
    [[fam]]
    [[m1,m2]]
        inherit = fam
\end{lstlisting}

To trigger other tasks off families we have to specify whether
to triggering off {\em all members} starting, succeeding, failing,
or finishing, or off {\em any} members (doing the same). Legal family
triggers are thus:

\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = """
      # all-member triggers:
    fam:start-all => one
    fam:succeed-all => one
    fam:fail-all => one
    fam:finish-all => one
      # any-member triggers:
    fam:start-any => one
    fam:succeed-any => one
    fam:fail-any => one
    fam:finish-any => one
                """
\end{lstlisting}

Here's how to trigger downstream processing after if one or more family
members succeed, but only after all members have finished (succeeded or
failed):

\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = """
    fam:finish-all & fam:succeed-any => foo
                """
\end{lstlisting}


\paragraph{Intercycle Triggers}
\label{IntercycleTriggers}

Typically most tasks in a suite will trigger off others in the same
cycle time, but some may depend on others with other cycle times. This
notably applies to warm-cycled forecast models, which depend
on their own previous instances (see below); but other kinds of
intercycle dependence are possible too.\footnote{In NWP forecast
analysis suites parts of the observation processing and data
assimilation subsystem will typically also depend on model background
fields generated by the previous forecast.} Here's how to express this
kind of relationship in cylc:
\begin{lstlisting}
[dependencies]
    [[0,6,12,18]]
        # B triggers off A in the previous cycle
        graph = "A[T-6] => B"
\end{lstlisting}
Intercycle and trigger type (and internal output) notation can be combined:
\begin{lstlisting}
    # B triggers if A in the previous cycle fails:
    graph = "A[T-6]:fail => B"
\end{lstlisting}

At suite start-up inter-cycle triggers refer to a previous cycle
that does not exist. This does not cause the dependent task to wait
indefinitely, however, because cylc ignores triggers that reach back
beyond the initial cycle time. That said, the presence of an inter-cycle
trigger does normally imply that something special has to happen at
start-up. If a model depends on its own previous instance for restart
files, for instance, then an initial set of restart files has to be
generated somehow or the first model task will presumably fail with
missing input files. There are several ways to handle this in cylc
using different kinds of one-off (non-cycling) tasks that run at suite
start-up.  They are illustrated in Tutorial
Section~\ref{TutIntercycleTriggers}; to summarize here briefly:

\begin{myitemize}
    \item initial {\em asynchronous tasks}:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = "prep"
        [[[0,12]]]
            graph = "prep & foo[T-12] => foo => bar"
\end{lstlisting}

    \item initial {\em start-up tasks}
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[special tasks]]
        start-up = prep
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[0,12]]]
            graph = "prep & foo[T-12] => foo => bar"
\end{lstlisting}

    \item initial {\em cold-start tasks}
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[special tasks]]
        cold-start = cfoo
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[0,12]]]
            graph = "cfoo | foo[T-12] => foo => bar"
\end{lstlisting}

\end{myitemize}

The first two cases are the same, except that {\em start-up} tasks are
assigned a cycle time (even thought they don't cycle) whereas {\em
asynchronous} tasks are not. In the first cycle the previous-cycle trigger is
ignored and the first cycling tasks trigger off the initial tasks; subsequently
dependence on the initial tasks is ignored and the inter-cycle trigger
takes effect. Cold-start tasks, on the other hand, can be used for real
model cold-start processes, whereby a warm-cycled model at any given cycle
time can in principle have its inputs satisfied by a previous instance of
itself, {\em or} by a cold-start task with (nominally) the same cycle time.
In effect, the cold-start task masquerades as the previous-cycle trigger
of its associated cycling task. At suite start-up cold-start tasks will
trigger the first cycling tasks, and thereafter the inter-cycle trigger
will take effect. Unlike for asynchronous and start-up initial tasks,
however, the cold-start ``OR'' construct means that cold-start triggers
don't have to be ignored by cylc after the first cycle, so it is
possible to insert cold-start task into a suite mid-run to do mid-stream
cold-starts after problems that preclude continued normal warm cycling.

One-off initial tasks can invoke real processing to generate the files
that are subsequently produced by a tasks in the previous cycle; or they
could be dummy tasks that represent some external process that does the
same before the suite is started - in which case the initial task can
just report itself successfully completed after checking that the
required files are present.

\paragraph{Sequential Tasks}
\label{SequentialTasks}

If a cycling task does not generate files required by its own successor,
then successive instances can run in parallel if the opportunity arises.
However, if such a task would interfere with its own siblings for
internal reasons (e.g.\ use of a hardwired non cycle time dependent
temporary file or similar) then it can be forced to run sequentially.
This can be done with explicit inter-cycle triggers in the graph:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[0,12]]]
            graph = "foo[T-12] => foo => bar"
\end{lstlisting}
or by declaring the task to be {\em sequential}:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[special tasks]]
        sequential = foo
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[0,12]]]
            graph = "foo => bar"
\end{lstlisting}

The {\em sequential} declaration also results in each instance of
\lstinline=foo= triggering off its own predecessor, exactly as in
the explicit version. The only difference is that implicit triggers will
not appear in graph visualizations. The implicit version can also be
considerably simpler when the task appears in multiple graph sections or
in a non-uniform cycling sequence: this suite,
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[special tasks]]
        sequential = foo
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[0,3,11]]]
            graph = "foo => bar"
\end{lstlisting}
is equivalent to this one:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[0,3,11]]]
            graph = "foo => bar"
        [[[0]]]
            graph = "foo[T-13] => foo"
        [[[3]]]
            graph = "foo[T-3] => foo"
        [[[11]]]
            graph = "foo[T-8] => foo"
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Warm Start}

For suites with inter-cycle dependence a {\em warm start} is essentially
an implicit restart. Rather than loading tasks from a previous recorded
suite state, cylc loads all cycling tasks at a given cycle time assuming
that the previous cycle was completed in an earlier suite run. Any initial
tasks - asynchronous, start-up, or cold-start - therefore do not need to
run again. Dependence on tasks from before the start cycle is still
ignored, but cold-start tasks have to be loaded in the {\em succeeded}
state because dependence on them (in the cold-start OR construct) is
retained throughout the suite run as is explained above in
Section~\ref{IntercycleTriggers}.

\paragraph{Future Triggers}

Cylc also supports inter-cycle triggering off tasks in the future (with respect to
cycle time!):
\begin{lstlisting}
[dependencies]
    [[0,6,12,18]]
        # B triggers off A in the next cycle
        graph = "A[T+6] => B"
\end{lstlisting}
In contrast to normal inter-cycle triggers, future triggers present a problem at the
suite stop time rather than at start-up - in the final cycle \lstinline=B= wants to
to trigger off \lstinline=A= at a future cycle time that does not exist.  To avoid
this problem cylc prevents tasks from spawning successors that depend on tasks in
a non-existent future cycle.

\subsubsection{Model Restart Dependencies}
\label{ModelRestartDependencies}

Warm-cycled forecast models generate {\em restart files}, e.g.\ model
background fields, to initialize the next forecast. This kind of
dependence requires an inter-cycle trigger:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[special tasks]]
        cold-start = ColdA
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[0,6,12,18]]]
            graph = "ColdA | A[T-6] => A"
\end{lstlisting}
Or if you don't need an explicit cold-start task, this will do:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[0,6,12,18]]]
            graph = "A[T-6] => A"
\end{lstlisting}
If the model can emit an explicit output message as soon as its
restart files are completed (see {\em Internal Message Outputs} -
Section~\ref{RIOC}) there's no need to wait for it to finish:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[0,6,12,18]]]
            graph = "A[T-6]:res1 => A"
[runtime]
    [[A]]
        command scripting = """
sleep 10
cylc message "restart files ready for $( cylc cycletime --offset-hours=6 )"
sleep 20"""
        [[[outputs]]]
            res1 = "restart files ready for [T+6]"
\end{lstlisting}

If your model is configured to write out additional restart files
to allow one or more cycles to be skipped in an emergency {\em do not
represent these potential dependencies in the suite graph} as they
should not be used under normal circumstances. For example, the
following graph would result in task \lstinline=A= erroneously
triggering off \lstinline=A[T-24]= as a matter of course, instead of
off \lstinline=A[T-6]=, because \lstinline=A[T-24]= will always
be finished first:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[0,6,12,18]]]
            # DO NOT DO THIS (SEE ACCOMPANYING TEXT):
            graph = "A[T-24] | A[T-18] | A[T-12] | A[T-6] => A"
\end{lstlisting}

If you need to skip one or more cycles in a suite like this, manually
remove the tasks that cannot run (or use \lstinline=cylc purge= to
remove their downstream dependents too) and manually trigger the first
post-gap task.

\subsection{Runtime - Task Configuration}
\label{NIORP}

The \lstinline=[runtime]= section of a suite definition configures what
to execute (and where and how to execute it) when each task is ready to
run, in a {\em multiple inheritance hierarchy} of {\em
namespaces} culminating in individual tasks. This allows all common
configuration detail to be factored out and defined in one place.

Any namespace can configure any or all of the items defined in the
{\em Suite.rc Reference}, Appendix~\ref{SuiteRCReference}.

Namespaces that do not explicitly inherit from others automatically
inherit from the {\em root} namespace (below).

Nested namespaces define {\em task families} that can be used in the
graph as convenient shorthand for triggering all member tasks at once,
or for triggering other tasks off all members at once - see {\em Family
Triggers}, Section~\ref{FamilyTriggers}.  Nested namespaces can be
progressively expanded and collapsed in the dependency graph viewer, and
in the gcylc graph and tree views. Only the first parent of each
namespace (as for single-inheritance) is used for suite visualization
purposes.

\subsubsection{Namespace Names}

Namespace names may contain letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens.
%They may not contain colons, which would preclude use of suite
%suite names in shell \lstinline=$PATH= variables. The
%`.' character is the suite registration hierarchy delimiter (which
%separates suite groups and names, e.g.\
%my\_suites.test.foo).

Note that {\em task names need not be hardwired into task
implementations} because task and suite identity can be extracted
portably from the task execution environment supplied by cylc
(Section~\ref{TaskExecutionEnvironment}) - then to rename a task you
can just change its name in the suite definition.

\subsubsection{Root - Runtime Defaults}

The root namespace, at the base of the inheritance hierarchy,
provides default configuration for all tasks in the suite.
Most root items are unset by default, but some have default values
sufficient to allow test suites to be defined by dependency graph alone.
The {\em command scripting} item, for example, defaults to code that
prints a message then sleeps for between 1 and 15 seconds and
exits. Default values are documented with each item in
Appendix~\ref{SuiteRCReference}.  You can override the defaults or
provide your own defaults by explicitly configuring the root namespace.
\subsubsection{Defining Multiple Namespaces At Once}
\label{MultiTaskDef}

If a namespace section heading is a comma-separated list of names
then the subsequent configuration applies to each list member.
Particular tasks can be singled out at run time using the
\lstinline=$CYLC_TASK_NAME= variable.

As an example, consider a suite containing an ensemble of closely
related tasks that each invokes the same script but with a unique
argument that identifies the calling task name:

\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[runtime]
    [[ensemble]]
        command scripting = "run-model.sh $CYLC_TASK_NAME"
    [[m1, m2, m3]]
        inherit = ensemble
\end{lstlisting}

For large ensembles Jinja2 template processing can be used to
automatically generate the member names and associated dependencies
(see Section~\ref{Jinja2}).

\subsubsection{Runtime Inheritance - Single}

The following listing of the {\em inherit.single.one} example suite
illustrates basic runtime inheritance with single parents.

\lstset{language=suiterc}
\lstinputlisting{../examples/inherit/single/one/suite.rc}
\lstset{language=transcript}

\subsubsection{Runtime Inheritance - Multiple}

If a namespace inherits from multiple parents the linear order of
precedence (which namespace overrides which) is determined by the
so-called {\em C3 algorithm} used to find the linear {\em method
resolution order} for class hierarchies in Python and several other
object oriented programming languages. The result of this should be
fairly obvious for typical use of multiple inheritance in cylc suites,
but for detailed documentation of how the algorithm works refer to the
official Python documentation here:
\lstinline=http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/=.

The {\em inherit.multi.one} example suite, listed here, makes use of
multiple inheritance:

\lstset{language=suiterc}
\lstinputlisting{../examples/inherit/multi/one/suite.rc}
\lstset{language=transcript}

\lstinline=cylc get-suite-config= provides an easy way to check the result of
inheritance in a suite. You can extract specific items, e.g.:
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc get-suite-config --item '[runtime][var_p2]command scripting' inherit.multi.one
echo ``RUN: run-var.sh''
\end{lstlisting}
or use the \lstinline=--sparse= option to print entire namespaces
without obscuring the result with the dense runtime structure obtained
from the root namespace:
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc get-suite-config --sparse --item '[runtime]ops_s1' inherit.multi.one
command scripting = echo ``RUN: run-ops.sh''
inherit = ['OPS', 'SERIAL']
[directives]
   job_type = serial
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Suite Visualization And Multiple Inheritance}

The first parent inherited by a namespace is also used as the
collapsible family group when visualizing the suite. If this is not what
you want, you can demote the first parent for visualization purposes,
without affecting the order of inheritance of runtime properties:
\begin{lstlisting}
[runtime]
    [[bar]]
        # ...
    [[foo]]
        # inherit properties from bar, but stay under root for visualization:
        inherit = None, bar
\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{How Runtime Inheritance Works}

The linear precedence order of ancestors is computed for each namespace
using the C3 algorithm. Then any runtime items that are explicitly
configured in the suite definition are ``inherited'' up the linearized
hierachy for each task, starting at the root namespace: if a particular
item is defined at multiple levels in the hiearchy, the level nearest
the final task namespace takes precedence.  Finally, root namespace
defaults are applied for every item that has not been configured in the
inheritance process (this is more efficient than carrying the full dense
namespace structure through from root from the beginning).

\subsubsection{Task Execution Environment}
\label{TaskExecutionEnvironment}

The task execution environment contains suite and task identity
variables provided by cylc, and user-defined environment variables.
The environment is explicitly exported (by the task job script) prior to
executing task command scripting (see {\em Task Job Submission},
Section~\ref{TaskJobSubmission}).

Suite and task identity are exported first, so that user-defined
variables can refer to them. Order of definition is preserved throughout
so that variable assignment expressions can safely refer to previously
defined variables.

Additionally, access to cylc itself is configured prior to the user-defined
environment, so that variable assignment expressions can make use of
cylc utility commands:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[runtime]
    [[foo]]
        [[[environment]]]
            REFERENCE_TIME = $( cylc util cycletime --offset-hours=6 )
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{User Environment Variables}

A task's user-defined environment results from its inherited
\lstinline=[[[environment]]]= sections:
\begin{lstlisting}
[runtime]
    [[root]]
        [[[environment]]]
            COLOR = red
            SHAPE = circle
    [[foo]]
        [[[environment]]]
            COLOR = blue  # root override
            TEXTURE = rough # new variable
\end{lstlisting}
This results in a task {\em foo} with
\lstinline@SHAPE=circle@,
\lstinline@COLOR=blue@, and
\lstinline@TEXTURE=rough@ in its environment.

\paragraph{Overriding Environment Variables}

When you override inherited namespace items the original parent
item definition is {\em replaced} by the new definition. This applies to
all items including those in the environment sub-sections which,
strictly speaking, are not ``environment variables'' until they are
written, post inheritance processing, to the task job script that
executes the associated task. Consequently, if you override an
environment variable you cannot also access the original parent value:
\begin{lstlisting}
[runtime]
    [[foo]]
        [[[environment]]]
            COLOR = red
    [[bar]]
        inherit = foo
        [[[environment]]]
            tmp = $COLOR        # !! ERROR: $COLOR is undefined here
            COLOR = dark-$tmp   # !! as this overrides COLOR in foo.
\end{lstlisting}
The compressed variant of this, \lstinline@COLOR = dark-$COLOR@, is
also in error for the same reason.  To achieve the desired result you
must use a different name for the parent variable:
\begin{lstlisting}
[runtime]
    [[foo]]
        [[[environment]]]
            FOO_COLOR = red
    [[bar]]
        inherit = foo
        [[[environment]]]
            COLOR = dark-$FOO_COLOR  # OK
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Suite And Task Identity Variables}

The task identity variables provided to tasks by cylc are:
\lstset{language=bash}
\begin{lstlisting}
$CYLC_TASK_ID                    # X.2011051118 (e.g.)
$CYLC_TASK_NAME                  # X
$CYLC_TASK_CYCLE_TIME            # 2011051118
$CYLC_TASK_LOG_ROOT              # ~/cylc-run/foo.bar.baz/log/job/X.2011051118.1
$CYLC_TASK_NAMESPACE_HIERARCHY   # "root postproc X" (e.g.)
$CYLC_TASK_TRY_NUMBER            # increments with automatic retry-on-fail
$CYLC_TASK_WORK_DIR              # task work directory (see below)
$CYLC_SUITE_SHARE_DIR            # suite (or task!) shared directory (see below)
$CYLC_TASK_IS_COLDSTART          # 'True' for cold-start tasks, else 'False'
\end{lstlisting}
And the suite identity variables are:
\begin{lstlisting}
$CYLC_SUITE_DEF_PATH   # $HOME/mysuites/baz (e.g.)
$CYLC_SUITE_NAME       # foo.bar.baz (e.g.)
$CYLC_SUITE_REG_PATH   # name translate to path: foo/bar/baz
$CYLC_SUITE_HOST       # orca.niwa.co.nz (e.g.)
$CYLC_SUITE_PORT       # 7766 (e.g.)
$CYLC_SUITE_OWNER      # hilary (e.g.)
\end{lstlisting}
Some of these variables are also used by cylc task messaging commands in
order to target the right task proxy object in the right suite.

\paragraph{Suite Share And Task Work Directories}

A {\em suite share directory} is created automatically for use as a file
exchange area for tasks on same task host. It can be accessed via
\lstinline=$CYLC_SUITE_SHARE_DIR= and its location can be set in the
cylc site and user config files.

A {\em task work directory} is also created automatically for each task,
and can be accessed via the \lstinline=$CYLC_TASK_WORK_DIR= variable.
Task command scripting is executed from within the work directory (i.e.\
it is the task's {\em current working directory}). For non-detaching
tasks the work directory is automatically removed again if it is empty
when the task finishes. The main work directory location is set in the
cylc site and user config files, but the lowest-level sub-directory, which
name defaults to the task ID to give each task a unique workspace, can
be overridden under \lstinline=[runtime]= in suite definitions. This
enables groups of tasks that read and write files from their current
working directories to be given common work directories as file share
spaces.

\paragraph{Other Cylc-Defined Environment Variables}

Initial and final cycle times, if supplied via the suite.rc file or the
command line, are passed to task execution environments as:
\begin{lstlisting}
$CYLC_SUITE_INITIAL_CYCLE_TIME
$CYLC_SUITE_FINAL_CYCLE_TIME
\end{lstlisting}
Tasks can use these to determine whether or not they are running
in the first or final cycles.

\lstset{language=transcript}


\paragraph{Environment Variable Evaluation}

Variables in the task execution environment are not evaluated in the
shell in which the suite is running prior to submitting the task. They
are written in unevaluated form to the job script that is submitted by
cylc to run the task (Section~\ref{JobScripts}) and are therefore
evaluated when the task begins executing under the task owner account
on the task host. Thus \lstinline=$HOME=, for instance, evaluates at
run time to the home directory of task owner on the task host.

\subsubsection{How Tasks Get Access To The Suite Directory}

Tasks can use \lstinline=$CYLC_SUITE_DEF_PATH= to access suite files on
the task host, and the suite bin directory is automatically added
\lstinline=$PATH=.  If a remote suite definition directory is not
specified the local (suite host) path will be assumed with the local
home directory, if present, swapped for literal \lstinline=$HOME= for
evaluation on the task host.

\subsubsection{Remote Task Hosting}
\label{RunningTasksOnARemoteHost}

If a task declares an owner other than the suite owner and/or
a host other than the suite host, cylc will use passwordless ssh to
execute the task on the \lstinline=owner@host= account by the configured
job submission method,
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[runtime]
    [[foo]]
        [[[remote]]]
            host = orca.niwa.co.nz
            owner = bob
        [[[job submission]]]
            method = pbs
\end{lstlisting}
\lstset{language=transcript}
For this to work,
\begin{myitemize}
    \item passwordless ssh must be configured between the suite and task
    host accounts.
    \item cylc must be installed on task hosts so that remote tasks can
    use cylc messaging and poll or kill commands.
    \begin{myitemize}
        \item Pyro and the suite passphrase are needed on tasks hosts,
            unless the ssh or polling task communication methods are
            used. Other cylc software dependencies such as graphviz and
        Jinja2 are not needed on task hosts.
    \end{myitemize}
    \item the suite definition directory, or some fraction of its
        content, can be installed on the task host, if needed.
\end{myitemize}

To learn how to give remote tasks access to cylc, see
Section~\ref{HowTasksGetAccessToCylc}.

Tasks running on the suite host under another user account are treated as
remote tasks.

Remote hosting, like all namespace settings, can be declared globally in
the root namespace, or per family, or for individual tasks.

\paragraph{Dynamic Host Selection}

Instead of hardwiring host names into the suite definition you can
specify a shell command that prints a hostname, or an environment
variable that holds a hostname, as the value of the host config item.
See Section~\ref{DynamicHostSelection}.

\paragraph{Remote Task Log Directories}

Task stdout and stderr streams are written to log files in a
suite-specific sub-directory of the {\em suite run directory}, as
explained in Section~\ref{WhitherStdoutAndStderr}. For remote tasks
the same directory is used, but {\em on the task host}.
Remote task log directories, like local ones, are created on the fly, if
necessary, during job submission.

\subsection{Visualization}
\label{viso}

The visualization section of a suite definition is used to configure
suite graphing, principally graph node (task) and edge (dependency
arrow) style attributes. Tasks can be grouped for the purpose of
applying common style attributes. See the suite.rc reference
(Appendix~\ref{SuiteRCReference}) for details.

\subsubsection{Collapsible Families In Suite Graphs}

\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[visualization]
    collapsed families = family1, family2
\end{lstlisting}
\lstset{language=transcript}

Nested families from the runtime inheritance hierarchy can be expanded
and collapsed in suite graphs and the gcylc graph view. All families
are displayed in the collapsed state at first, unless
\lstinline=[visualization]collapsed families= is used to single out
specific families for initial collapsing.

In the gcylc graph view, nodes outside of the main graph (such as the
members of collapsed families) are plotted as rectangular nodes to
the right if they are doing anything interesting (submitted, running,
failed).

Figure~\ref{fig-namespaces} illustrates successive expansion of nested task
families in the {\em namespaces} example suite.

\label{fig-namespaces}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Jinja2}
\label{Jinja2}

Cylc has built in support for the Jinja2 template processor in suite
definitions. Jinja2 variables, mathematical expressions, loop control
structures, conditional logic, etc., are automatically processed to
generate the final suite definition seen by cylc.

The need for Jinja2 processing must be declared with a hash-bang
comment as the first line of the suite.rc file:
\begin{lstlisting}
#!jinja2
# ...
\end{lstlisting}

Potential uses for this include automatic generation of repeated groups
of similar tasks and dependencies, and inclusion or exclusion of entire
suite sections according to the value of a single flag.  Consider a
large complicated operational suite and several related parallel test
suites with slightly different task content and structure (the parallel
suites, for instance, might take certain large input files from the
operation or the archive rather than downloading them again) - these can
now be maintained as a single master suite definition that reconfigures
itself according to the value of a flag variable indicating the intended use.

Template processing is the first thing done on parsing a suite
definition so Jinja2 expressions can appear anywhere in the file (inside
strings and namespace headings, for example).

Jinja2 is well documented at \url{http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs}, so here
we just provide an example suite that uses it. The meaning of the
embedded Jinja2 code should be reasonably self-evident to anyone familiar
with standard programming techniques.

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=10cm]{graphics/png/orig/jinja2-ensemble-graph.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption[The Jinja2 ensemble example suite graph.]{\scriptsize
    The Jinja2 ensemble example suite graph.}
    \label{fig-jinja2-ensemble}
\end{figure}

The \lstinline=jinja2.ensemble= example, graphed in
Figure~\ref{fig-jinja2-ensemble}, shows an ensemble of similar tasks
generated using Jinja2:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
#!jinja2
{% set N_MEMBERS = 5 %}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = """{# generate ensemble dependencies #}
            {% for I in range( 0, N_MEMBERS ) %}
               foo => mem_{{ I }} => post_{{ I }} => bar
            {% endfor %}"""
\end{lstlisting}
Here is the generated suite definition, after Jinja2 processing:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
#!jinja2
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = """
          foo => mem_0 => post_0 => bar
          foo => mem_1 => post_1 => bar
          foo => mem_2 => post_2 => bar
          foo => mem_3 => post_3 => bar
          foo => mem_4 => post_4 => bar
                """
\end{lstlisting}

And finally, the \lstinline=jinja2.cities= example uses variables,
includes or excludes special cleanup tasks according to the value of a
logical flag, and it automatically generates all dependencies and family
relationships for a group of tasks that is repeated for each city in the
suite. To add a new city and associated tasks and dependencies simply
add the city name to list at the top of the file. The suite is graphed,
with the New York City task family expanded, in
Figure~\ref{fig-jinja2-cities}.

\lstset{language=suiterc}
\lstinputlisting{../examples/jinja2/cities/suite.rc}
\lstset{language=transcript}

\begin{figure}
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=16cm]{graphics/png/orig/jinja2-suite-graph.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption[Jinja2 cities example suite graph.]{\scriptsize
    The Jinja2 cities example suite graph, with the
    New York City task family expanded.}
    \label{fig-jinja2-cities}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Accessing Environment Variables With Jinja2}

This functionality is not provided by Jinja2 by default, but cylc
automatically imports the user environment to the template in a
dictionary structure called {\em environ}. A usage example:
\begin{lstlisting}
#!Jinja2
#...
[runtime]
    [[root]]
        [[[environment]]]
            SUITE_OWNER_HOME_DIR_ON_SUITE_HOST = {{environ['HOME']}}
\end{lstlisting}
This example is emphasizes that {\em the environment is read on the suite
host at the time the suite definition is parsed} - it is not, for
instance, read at task run time on the task host.

\subsubsection{Custom Jinja2 Filters}

Jinja2 variable values can be modified by ``filters'', using pipe
notation. For example, the built-in \lstinline=trim= filter strips
leading and trailing white space from a string:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
{% set MyString = "   dog   " %}
{{ MyString | trim() }}  # "dog"
\end{lstlisting}
(See official Jinja2 documentation for available built-in filters.)

Cylc also supports custom Jinja2 filters. A custom filter is a
single Python function in a source file with the same name as the
function (plus ``.py'' extension) and stored in one of the following
locations:
\begin{myitemize}
    \item \lstinline=$CYLC_DIR/lib/Jinja2Filters/=
    \item \lstinline=[suite definition directory]/Jinja2Filters/=
    \item \lstinline=$HOME/.cylc/Jinja2Filters/=
\end{myitemize}

In the filter function argument list, the first argument is the variable
value to be ``filtered'', and subsequent arguments can be whatever is
needed. Currently there is one custom filter called ``pad'' in the
central cylc Jinja2 filter directory, for padding string values to some
constant length with a fill character - useful for generating task names
and related values in ensemble suites:

\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
{% for i in range(0,100) %}  # 0, 1, ..., 99
    {% set j = i | pad(2,'0') %}
    A_{{j}}          # A_00, A_01, ..., A_99
{% endfor %}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Associative Arrays In Jinja2}

Associative arrays ({\em dicts} in Python) can be very useful. Here's an
example, from \lstinline=$CYLC_DIR/examples/jinja2/dict=:

\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
#!Jinja2
{% set obs_types = ['airs', 'iasi'] %}
{% set resource = { 'airs':'ncpus=9', 'iasi':'ncpus=20' } %}

[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = "obs"
[runtime]
    [[obs]]
        [[[job submission]]]
            method = pbs
    {% for i in obs_types %}
    [[ {{i}} ]]
        inherit = obs
        [[[directives]]]
             -I = {{ resource[i] }}
     {% endfor %}
 \end{lstlisting}

Here's the result:
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc get-suite-config -i [runtime][airs]directives SUITE 
-I = ncpus=9
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Jinja2 Default Values And Template Inputs}

The values of Jinja2 variables can be passed in from the cylc command
line rather than hardwired in the suite definition. Here's an example,
from \lstinline=$CYLC_DIR/examples/jinja2/defaults=:

\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
#!Jinja2

title = "Jinja2 example: use of defaults and external input"

description = """
The template variable FIRST_TASK must be given on the cylc command line
using --set or --set-file=FILE; two other variables, LAST_TASK and
N_MEMBERS can be set similarly, but if not they have default values."""

{% set LAST_TASK = LAST_TASK | default( 'baz' ) %}
{% set N_MEMBERS = N_MEMBERS | default( 3 ) | int %}

{# input of FIRST_TASK is required - no default #}

[scheduling]
    initial cycle time = 2010080800
    final cycle time   = 2010081600
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[0]]]
            graph = """{{ FIRST_TASK }} => ens
                 ens:succeed-all => {{ LAST_TASK }}"""
[runtime]
    [[ens]]
{% for I in range( 0, N_MEMBERS ) %}
    [[ mem_{{ I }} ]]
        inherit = ens
{% endfor %}
\end{lstlisting}

Here's the result:

\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc list SUITE
Jinja2 Template Error
'FIRST_TASK' is undefined
cylc-list foo  failed:  1

shell$ cylc list --set FIRST_TASK=bob foo
bob
baz
mem_2
mem_1
mem_0

shell$ cylc list --set FIRST_TASK=bob --set LAST_TASK=alice foo
bob
alice
mem_2
mem_1
mem_0

list --set FIRST_TASK=bob --set N_MEMBERS=10 foo
mem_9
mem_8
mem_7
mem_6
mem_5
mem_4
mem_3
mem_2
mem_1
mem_0
baz
bob
\end{lstlisting}

\lstset{language=suiterc}
Note also that
\lstinline=cylc view --set FIRST_TASK=bob --jinja2 SUITE= will show the
suite with the Jinja2 variables as set.

{\em Warning:} suites started with template variables set on the command
line do not currently {\em restart} with the same settings - you have to
set them again on the \lstinline=cylc restart= command line.

\subsection{Special Placeholder Variables}
\label{SPHV}

Several special variables are used as placeholders in cylc suite definitions:

\begin{myitemize}
    \item \lstinline=[T]= and \lstinline=[T+n]= \newline
        Where \lstinline=n= is an integer cycle time offset, the unit
        of which (e.g. hours, days, months, or years) is determined by
        the cycling module in use. This is replaced, in internal task
        message strings under the runtime outputs config section, by the
        actual offset cycle time of the task. The syntax is the same as
        for cycle time offsets in the suite graph.

    \item \lstinline=<ASYNCID>=\newline
        This is replaced with the actual ``asynchronous ID'' (e.g.
        satellite pass ID) for repeating asynchronous tasks.
\end{myitemize}

To use proper variables (c.f.\ programming languages) in suite
definitions, see the Jinja2 template processor (Section~\ref{Jinja2}).

\subsection{Omitting Tasks At Runtime}

It is sometimes convenient to omit certain tasks from the suite at
runtime without actually deleting their definitions from the suite.

Defining [runtime] properties for tasks that do not appear in the suite
graph results in verbose-mode validation warnings that the tasks are
disabled. They cannot be used because the suite graph is what defines
their dependencies and valid cycle times.  Nevertheless, it is legal to
leave these orphaned runtime sections in the suite definition because it
allows you to temporarily remove tasks from the suite by simply
commenting them out of the graph.

To omit a task from the suite at runtime but still leave it fully
defined and available for use (by insertion or \lstinline=cylc submit=)
use one or both of [scheduling][[special task]] lists, {\em include at
start-up} or {\em exclude at start-up} (documented in
Sections~\ref{IASU} and~\ref{EASU}). Then the graph still defines the
validity of the tasks and their dependencies, but they are not actually
inserted into the suite at start-up. Other tasks that depend on the
omitted ones, if any, will have to wait on their insertion at a later
time or otherwise be triggered manually.

Finally, with Jinja2 (Section~\ref{Jinja2}) you can radically alter
suite structure by including or excluding tasks from the [scheduling]
and [runtime] sections according to the value of a single logical flag
defined at the top of the suite.
\subsection{Naked Dummy Tasks And Strict Validation}

A {\em naked dummy task} appears in the suite graph but has no
explicit runtime configuration section. Such tasks automatically
inherit the default ``dummy task'' configuration from the root
namespace. This is very useful because it allows functional suites to
be mocked up quickly for test and demonstration purposes by simply
defining the graph. It is somewhat dangerous, however, because there
is no way to distinguish an intentional naked dummy task from one
generated by typographic error: misspelling a task name in the graph
results in a new naked dummy task replacing the intended task in the
affected trigger expression; and misspelling a task name in a runtime
section heading results in the intended task becoming a dummy task
itself (by divorcing it from its intended runtime config section).

To avoid this problem any dummy task used in a real suite should not be
naked - i.e.\ it should have an explicit entry in under the runtime
section of the suite definition, even if the section is empty. This
results in exactly the same dummy task behaviour, via implicit
inheritance from root, but it allows use of
\lstinline=cylc validate --strict=
to catch errors in task names by failing the suite if any naked dummy
tasks are detected.

\section{Task Implementation}
\label{TaskImplementation}

Existing tasks (models, scripts, etc.) can be used by cylc without any
modification, with the following few exceptions:
\begin{myitemize}
    \item tasks that do not return error status on error
    \item tasks with internal outputs that others need to trigger off
        before the task is finished
    \item tasks that spawn internal processes and then detach and exit early
\end{myitemize}

\subsection{Inlined Tasks}

Simple tasks can be entirely implemented within the suite.rc file -
task {\em command scripting} can be a multi-line string.

\subsection{Returning Proper Error Status}

Tasks should abort with non-zero exit status if a fatal error occurs
(this is just standard coding practice anyway). This allows cylc's task
job scripts to automatically trap errors and send a
\lstinline=cylc task failed= message back to the suite. The shell
\lstinline=set -e= option can be used in lieu of explicit error
checks for every command:
\lstset{language=bash}
\begin{lstlisting}
#!/bin/bash
set -e  # abort on error
mkdir /illegal/dir  # this will abort the script with error status
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Reporting Internal (Message) Outputs}
\label{RIOC}

If a task has {\em internal outputs} that others need to trigger off
before the task is finished, then it must report completion of those
outputs to the suite daemon. These messages must exactly match
corresponding {\em outputs} registered for the task in the suite
definition, and for cycling tasks they should contain the cycle time in
order to distinguish between the outputs of different instances of the
same task.

The ``outputs'' example is a self-contained suite that illustrates this:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\lstinputlisting{../examples/outputs/suite.rc}
Compare the registered message string, which uses \lstinline=[T]= as
a placeholder for the cycle time, with the actual message emitted
by the task, which uses \lstinline=$CYLC_TASK_CYCLE_TIME=. The
registered message string is held in the suite daemon to be matched
with incoming task messages - it cannot contain shell variables because
is never interpreted by the shell.

See {\em Model Restart Dependencies}
(Section~\ref{ModelRestartDependencies}) for an example that uses
cycle time offsets in message outputs.

\subsection{Other Task Messages}

General (non-output) messages can also be sent to report progress,
warnings, and so on, e.g.:
\lstset{language=bash}
\begin{lstlisting}
#!/bin/bash
# a warning message (this will be logged by the suite):
cylc task message -p WARNING "oops, something's fishy here"
# information (this will also be logged by the suite):
cylc task message "Hello from task foo"
\end{lstlisting}

Explanatory messages can be sent before aborting on error:
\lstset{language=bash}
\begin{lstlisting}
#!/bin/bash
set -e  # abort on error
if ! mkdir /illegal/dir; then
    # (use inline error checking to avoid triggering the above 'set -e')
    cylc task message -p CRITICAL "Failed to create directory /illegal/dir"
    exit 1 # now abort non-zero exit status to trigger the task failed message
fi
\end{lstlisting}
Or equivalently, with different syntax:
\lstset{language=bash}
\begin{lstlisting}
#!/bin/bash
set -e
mkdir /illegal/dir || {  # inline error checking using OR operator
    cylc task message -p CRITICAL "Failed to create directory /illegal/dir"
    exit 1
}
\end{lstlisting}
But not this:
\lstset{language=bash}
\begin{lstlisting}
#!/bin/bash
set -e
mkdir /illegal/dir  # aborted via 'set -e'
if [[ $? != 0 ]]; then  # so this will never be reached.
    cylc task message -p CRITICAL "Failed to create directory /illegal/dir"
    exit 1
fi
\end{lstlisting}
If critical errors are not reported in this way task failures will still
be detected and logged by cylc, but you may have to examine task logs to
determine what the problem was.

\subsection{Detaching Tasks}
\label{DetachingTasks}

If a task spawns another job internally and then detaches and exits
without seeing the spawned process through, you must arrange for the
detached process to send its own completion messages, because the
cylc-generated job script cannot know when it is finished.

First check that you can't ``reconnect'' the detaching process. If
it is a background shell process, for instance, just run it in the
foreground instead. For loadleveler jobs the \lstinline=-s= option
prevents \lstinline=llsubmit= from returning until the job has
completed. For Sun Grid Engine, \lstinline=qsub -sync yes= has the same
effect.  Section~\ref{CommandTemplate} shows how to override job
submission command template to achieve this.

If the detaching process cannot be reconnected, disable cylc's automatic
completion messaging:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[runtime]
    [[foo]]
        manual completion = False # this is a detching task
\end{lstlisting}

The cylc messaging commands are called like this:
\lstset{language=bash}
\begin{lstlisting}
#!/bin/bash
# ...
if $SUCCESS; then
    # release my task lock and report success
    cylc task succeeded
    exit 0
else
    # release my task lock and report failed
    cylc task failed "Input file X not found"
    exit 1
fi
\end{lstlisting}
They read environment variables that identify the calling task and the
target suite, so the task execution environment must be propagated to
the deatched process.

One way to handle this is to write a {\em task wrapper} that modifies a
copy of the detaching native job scripts, on the fly, to insert
completion messaging in the appropriate places. An advantage of this
method is that you don't need to permanently modify the model or its
associated native scripting for cylc. Another is that you can configure
the native job setup for a single test case (running it without cylc)
and then have your custom wrapper modify the standalone test case on the
fly with suite, task, and cycle-specific parameters as required.

To make this easier, for tasks that declare manual completion
messaging cylc makes non user-defined environment scripting
available in a variable \lstinline=$CYLC_SUITE_ENVIRONMENT=,
the value of which can be inserted at the appropriate point in the
task scripts (just prior to calling the cylc messaging
commands as above).\footnote{Note that \lstinline=$CYLC_SUITE_ENVIRONMENT= is
a string containing embedded newline characters and it has
to be handled accordingly. In the bash shell, for instance, it should
be echoed in quotes to avoid concatenation to a single line.}

\subsubsection{Detaching Tasks And Polling}

Another reason to avoid detaching tasks if possible is that they cannot
be polled or killed because there is no way for cylc to determine the
job ID of the detached process. Attempted polling of a detaching task
will just result in cylc logging a warning message.

\subsubsection{A Custom Detaching Task Wrapper Example}

The {\em detaching} example suite contains a script
\lstinline=model.sh= that runs a pseudo model as follows:
\lstset{language=bash}
\lstinputlisting{../examples/detaching/native/model.sh}
this is in turn executed by a script \lstinline=run-model.sh= that
detaches immediately after job submission (i.e.\ it exits before the
model executable actually runs):
\lstinputlisting{../examples/detaching/native/run-model.sh}
{\em Note that your {\bf at} scheduler daemon must be up
if you want to test this suite.}

Here's a cylc suite to run this unruly model:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\lstinputlisting{../examples/detaching/suite.rc}
\lstset{language=bash}
The suite invokes the task by means of the custom wrapper
\lstinline=model-wrapper.sh= which modifies, on the fly,
a temporary copy of the model's native job scripts as described above:
\lstinputlisting{../examples/detaching/bin/model-wrapper.sh}
\lstset{language=transcript}
If you run this suite, or submit the model task alone with
\lstinline=cylc submit=, you'll find that the usual job submission
log files for task stdout and stderr end before the task is finished.
To see the ``model'' output and the final task completion message
(success or failure), examine the log files generated by the
job submitted internally to the {\em at} scheduler (their
location is determined by the \lstinline=$PREFIX= variable in the
suite.rc file).

It should not be difficult to adapt this example to real tasks
with detaching internal job submission.  You will probably also need to
replace other parameters, such as model input and output filenames, with
suite- and cycle-appropriate values, but exactly the same technique can
be used: identify which job script needs to be modified and use text
processing tools (such as the single line {\em perl} search-and-replace
expressions above) to do the job.

\section{Task Job Submission, Poll and Kill}
\label{TaskJobSubmission}

{\em Task Implementation} (Section~\ref{TaskImplementation}) describes
what requirements a command, script, or program, must fulfill in order
to function as a cylc task. This section explains how tasks are submitted
by cylc when they are ready to run, and how to define new task job
submission methods.

\subsection{Job Poll And Kill Support}

For most job submission methods cylc now supports polling for real task
status, and job kill, from the gcylc GUI and command line
(\lstinline=cylc poll= and \lstinline=cylc kill=).
In addition to on-demand polling, submitted and running tasks are polled
automatically on suite restart (Section~\ref{RestartingSuites})
and on job submission and execution timeouts, and one-way polling can be
used as regular health check for submitted tasks, and to track tasks on
hosts that do not allow return routing for task messaging
(Section~\ref{RunningSuites}).

\subsubsection{Exceptions}

Task poll and kill support has not yet been added to the {\em SGE} and
{\em slurm} job submission methods. It will be added in an upcoming
release.

\subsection{Task Job Scripts}
\label{JobScripts}

When a task is ready to run cylc generates a temporary {\em task job
script} to configure the task's execution environment and call its
command scripting. The job script is the embodiment of all suite.rc
runtime settings for the task.  It is submitted to run by the {\em job
submission method} configured for the task. Different tasks can have
different job submission methods. Like other runtime properties,
you can set a suite default job submission method and override it for
specific tasks or families:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[runtime]
   [[root]] # suite defaults
        [[[job submission]]]
            method = loadleveler
   [[foo]] # just task foo
        [[[job submission]]]
            method = at
\end{lstlisting}

As shown in the Tutorial Section~\ref{RunningSuitesCLI}, job scripts are
saved to the suite run directory; the commands used to submit them are
printed to stdout by cylc; and they can be printed with the
\lstinline=cylc log= command or new ones generated and printed with the
\lstinline=cylc jobscript= command.  Take a look at one to see exactly
how cylc wraps and runs your tasks.

\subsection{Supported Job Submission Methods}
\label{AvailableMethods}

Cylc supports a number of commonly used job submission methods, and
Section~\ref{DefiningNewJobSubmissionMethods} shows how to add
support for other user-defined job submission methods.

\subsubsection{background}

Runs tasks directly in a background shell.

\subsubsection{at}

Submits tasks to the rudimentary Unix \lstinline=at= scheduler. The
\lstinline=atd= daemon must be running.

\subsubsection{loadleveler}

Submits tasks to loadleveler by the \lstinline=llsubmit= command.
Loadleveler directives can be provided in the suite.rc file:

\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[runtime]
    [[__NAME__]]
        [[[directives]]]
            foo = bar
            baz = qux
\end{lstlisting}
These are written to the top of the task job script like this:
\lstset{language=bash}
\begin{lstlisting}
#!/bin/bash
# DIRECTIVES
# @ foo = bar
# @ baz = qux
# @ queue
\end{lstlisting}

If restart=yes is specified as a directive for loadleveler, the job will
automatically trap SIGUSR1, which loadleveler may use to preempt the job. On
trapping SIGUSR1, the job will inform the suite that it has been vacated by
loadleveler. This will put it back to the submitted state, until it starts
running again.

\subsubsection{pbs}

Submits tasks to PBS (or Torque) by the \lstinline=qsub= command.  PBS
directives can be provided in the suite.rc file:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[runtime]
    [[__NAME__]]
        [[[directives]]]
            -q = foo
            -l = 'nodes=1,walltime=00:01:00'
\end{lstlisting}
These are written to the top of the task job script like this:
\lstset{language=bash}
\begin{lstlisting}
#!/bin/bash
# DIRECTIVES
#PBS -q foo
#PBS -l nodes=1,walltime=00:01:00
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{sge}

Submits tasks to Sun/Oracle Grid Engine by the \lstinline=qsub= command.
SGE directives can be provided in the suite.rc file:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[runtime]
    [[__NAME__]]
        [[[directives]]]
            -cwd = ' '
            -q = foo
            -l = 'h_data=1024M,h_rt=24:00:00'
\end{lstlisting}
These are written to the top of the task job script like this:
\lstset{language=bash}
\begin{lstlisting}
#!/bin/bash
# DIRECTIVES
#$ -cwd
#$ -q foo
#$ -l h_data=1024M,h_rt=24:00:00
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{slurm}

Submits tasks to Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management by the
\lstinline=sbatch= command.  SLURM directives can be provided in the
suite.rc file (note that since not all SLURM commands have a short form,
cylc requires the long form directives):
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[runtime]
    [[__NAME__]]
        [[[directives]]]
            --nodes = 5
            --time = 1:00:00
            --account = QXZ5W2
\end{lstlisting}
These are written to the top of the task job script like this:
\lstset{language=bash}
\begin{lstlisting}
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --nodes=5
#SBATCH --time=1:00:00
#SBATCH --account=QXZ5W2
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Default Directives Provided}

For job submission methods that use job file directives (PBS,
Loadlevler, etc.) default directives are provided to set the job name
and stdout and stderr file paths.

\subsubsection{Cylc Quirks (PBS,SGE,...) }

As shown in the example above, multiple entries for the same PBS or SGE
directive option must be comma-separated on the same line, in the
suite.rc file.  Otherwise, repeating the option on another line will
override the previous entry, not add to it.  Also, the right-hand side
must be quoted to hide the comma from the suite.rc parser (commas indicate
list values, whereas directives are treated as singular).

As also shown in the example above, to get a naked option flag such as
\lstinline=-cwd= in SGE you must give a quoted blank space as the
directive value in the suite.rc file.

\subsection{Task stdout And stderr Logs}
\label{WhitherStdoutAndStderr}

When a task is ready to run cylc generates a filename root to be used
for the task job script and log files. The filename containing the task
name, cycle time (or integer tag), and a submit number that increments
if the same task is re-triggered multiple times:
\lstset{language=bash}
\begin{lstlisting}
# task job script:
~/cylc-run/tut.oneoff.basic/log/job/hello.1.1
# task stdout:
~/cylc-run/tut.oneoff.basic/log/job/hello.1.out
# task stderr:
~/cylc-run/tut.oneoff.basic/log/job/hello.1.err
\end{lstlisting}

How the stdout and stderr streams are directed into these files depends
on the job submission method. The \lstinline=background= method just uses
appropriate output redirection on the command line, as shown above. The
\lstinline=loadleveler= method writes appropriate directives to the job
script that is submitted to loadleveler.

Cylc obviously has no control over the stdout and stderr output from
tasks that do their own internal output management (e.g.\ tasks
that submit internal jobs and direct the associated output to other
files). For less internally complex tasks, however, the files referred
to here will be complete task job logs.

\subsection{Overriding The Job Submission Command}
\label{CommandTemplate}

\lstset{language=suiterc}
To change the form of the actual command used to submit a job you do not
need to define a new job submission method; just override the
\lstinline=command template= in the relevant job submission sections of
your suite.rc file:
\begin{lstlisting}
[runtime]
    [[root]]
        [[[job submission]]]
            method = loadleveler
            # Use '-s' to stop llsubmit returning until all job steps have completed:
            command template = llsubmit -s %s
\end{lstlisting}
As explained in the suite.rc reference (Appendix~\ref{SuiteRCReference}),
the template's first \%s will be substituted by the job file path and,
where applicable a second and third \%s will be substituted by the paths
to the job stdout and stderr files.

\subsection{Defining New Job Submission Methods}
\label{DefiningNewJobSubmissionMethods}

Defining a new job submission method requires a little Python
programming. You can derive (in the sense of object oriented programming
inheritance) new methods from one of the existing ones, or directly from
cylc's job submission base class,
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
$CYLC_DIR/lib/cylc/job_submission/job_submit.py
\end{lstlisting}
using the existing job submission methods as examples.
\lstset{language=Python}

\subsubsection{An Example}

The following user-defined job submission class, called {\em qsub},
overrides the built-in {\em pbs} class to change the directive
prefix from \lstinline=#PBS= to \lstinline=#QSUB=:

\begin{lstlisting}
#!/usr/bin/env python

# to import from outside of the cylc source tree:
from cylc.job_submission.pbs import pbs
# OR, from $CYLC_DIR/lib/cylc/job_submission
# from pbs import pbs

class qsub( pbs ):
    """
This is a user-defined job submission method that overrides the '#PBS'
directive prefix of the built-in pbs method.
    """
    def set_directives( self ):
        pbs.set_directives( self )
        # override the '#PBS' directive prefix
        self.directive_prefix = "#QSUB"
\end{lstlisting}

To check that this works correctly save the new source file to
\lstinline=qsub.py= in one of the allowed locations (see just below),
use it in a suite definition:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
# SUITE.rc
# $HOME/test/suite.rc
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = "a"
[runtime]
    [[root]]
        [[[job submission]]]
            method = qsub
        [[[directives]]]
            -I = bar=baz
            -l = 'nodes=1,walltime=00:01:00'
            -cwd = ' '
\end{lstlisting}
and generate a job script to see the resulting directives:
\lstset{language=bash}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc db reg test $HOME/test
shell$ cylc jobscript test a | grep QSUB
#QSUB -e /home/hilary/cylc-run/pbs/log/job/a.1.1.err
#QSUB -l nodes=1,walltime=00:01:00
#QSUB -o /home/hilary/cylc-run/pbs/log/job/a.1.1.out
#QSUB -N a.1
#QSUB -I bar=baz
#QSUB -cwd
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Where To Put New Job Submission Modules}

You new job submission class code should be saved to a file with
the same name as the class (plus ``.py'' extension). It can reside
in any of the following locations, depending on how generally useful
the new method is and whether or not you have write-access to the cylc
source tree:
\begin{myitemize}

\section{Running Suites}
\label{RunningSuites}

To learn how to control running suites please also see the Tutorial
(Section~\ref{Tutorial}, command documentation
(Section~\ref{CommandReference}), and experiment with plenty of test
suites.

\subsection{How Tasks Interact With Running Suites}
\label{TaskComms}

Cylc has three ways of tracking the progress of tasks, configured per
task host in the site and user config files
(Section~\ref{SiteAndUserConfiguration}).
All three methods can be used on different task hosts within the same
suite if necessary.
\begin{myenumerate}
\item {\bf task-to-suite messaging:} cylc job scripts encapsulate task
scripting in a wrapper that automatically invokes messaging commands to
report progress back to the suite. The messaging commands can be
configured to work in two different ways:
    \begin{myenumerate}
        \item {\bf Pyro:} direct messaging via network sockets using
        Pyro (Python Remote Objects).
        \item {\bf ssh:} for tasks hosts that block access to the
        network ports required by Pyro, cylc can use passwordless ssh to
        re-invoke task messaging commands on the suite host (where
        ultimately Pyro is still used to connect to the server process).
    \end{myenumerate}
\item {\bf polling:} for task hosts that do not allow return routing to
the suite host for Pyro or ssh, cylc can poll tasks at configurable
intervals, using passwordless ssh.
\end{myenumerate}

The Pyro communication method is the default because it is the most
direct and efficient; the ssh method inserts an extra step in the
process (command re-invocation on the suite host); and task polling is
the least efficient because results are checked at predetermined
intervals, not when task events actually occur.

\subsubsection{Task Polling}

Be careful to avoid spamming task hosts with polling commands. Each poll
opens (and then closes) a new ssh connection. Polling subprocesses are
batched by cylc, and the number invoked at once can be configured in the
suite definition:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[cylc]
    [[poll and kill command submission]]
        batch size = 5  # default 10
        delay between batches = 10 # seconds, default 0
\end{lstlisting}

Polling intervals are configurable here because they should be
appropriate to the expected task run length. For instance, a task that
typically takes an hour to run might be polled every 10 minutes
initially, and then every minute toward the end of its run. Interval
values are used in turn until the last value, which is used repeatedly
until finished:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[runtime]
    [[foo]]
        # poll every minute in the 'submitted' state:
        submission polling intervals = 1.0
        # poll one minute after foo starts running, then every 10
        # minutes for 50 minutes, then every minute until finished:
        execution polling intervals = 1.0, 5*10.0, 1.0
\end{lstlisting}
A list of intervals with optional multipliers can be used for both
submission and execution polling, although a single value is probably
sufficient for submission polling. If these items are not configured
default values from site and user config will be used for the polling
task communication method; polling is not done by default under the
other task communications methods (but it can still be used if you
like).

Polling is also done automatically once on job submission and execution
timeouts, to see if the timed-out task has failed or not; and on suite
restarts, to see what happened to any tasks that were orphaned when the
suite went down.

\subsection{Alternatives To Polling When Routing Is Blocked}

If Pyro and ssh ports are blocked but you don't want to use polling from
the suite host,
\begin{myitemize}
\item it has been suggested that network {\em port forwarding} may
provide a solution;
\item you may be able to persuade system administrators to provide
network routing to one or more dedicated cylc servers;
\item it is possible to run cylc itself on HPC login nodes, but
depending on what software is installed there this may preclude use
of the gcylc GUI and suite visualization tools.
\end{myitemize}

\subsection{Task Host Communications Configuration}

Here are the site and user config items relevant to task tracking:

\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
#SITE AND USER CONFIG

# Task messaging settings affect task-to-suite communications.
[task messaging]
    # If a message send fails, retry after this delay:
    retry interval in seconds = float( min=1, default=5 )
    # If send fails after this many tries, give up trying:
    maximum number of tries = integer( min=1, default=7 )

    # This timeout is the same as --pyro-timeout for user commands. If
    # set to None (no timeout) message send to non-responsive suite
    # (e.g. suspended with Ctrl-Z) could hang indefinitely.
    connection timeout in seconds = float( min=1, default=30 )

# Pyro is required for communications between cylc clients and servers
# (i.e. between suite-connecting commands and guis, and running suite
# server processes).
[pyro]

    # Each suite listens on a dedicated network port.
    # Servers bind on the first port available from the base port up:
# SITE ONLY
    base port = integer( default=7766 )

    # This sets the maximum number of suites that can run at once.
# SITE ONLY
    maximum number of ports = integer( default=100 )

    # Port numbers are recorded in this directory, by suite name.
    ports directory = string( default="$HOME/.cylc/ports/" )

[hosts]
    # The default task host is the suite host, i.e. localhost:
    # Add task host sections if local defaults are not sufficient.
    [[HOST]]
       # Method of communication of task progress back to the suite:
        #   1) pyro - direct client-server RPC via network ports
        #   2) ssh  - re-invoke pyro messaging commands on suite server
        #   3) poll - the suite polls for status of passive tasks
        # Pyro RPC is still required in all cases *on the suite host*
        # for cylc clients (commands etc.) to communicate with suites.
        task communication method = option( "pyro", "ssh", "poll", default="pyro" )
        # The "poll" method sets a default interval here to ensure no
        # tasks are accidentally left unpolled. You should override this
        # with run-length appropriate intervals under task [runtime] -
        # which will also result in routine polling to check task health
        # under the pyro or ssh communications methods.
        default polling interval in minutes = float( min=0.1, default=1.0 )
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{How Commands Interact With Running Suites}

User-invoked commands that connect to running suites can also choose
between direct communication across network sockets (Pyro) and
re-invocation of commands on the suite host using passwordless ssh
(there is a \lstinline=--use-ssh= command option for this purpose).

The gcylc GUI requires direct Pyro connections to its target suite. If
that is not possible, run gcylc on the suite host.


\subsection{Connection Authentication}
\label{ConnectionAuthentication}

All Pyro connections to a running suite (task messaging and
user-invoked commands) must authenticate with an arbitary single line of
text in a file called \lstinline=passphrase=, which will be found and
used automatically if installed properly - see below.  A secure MD5
checksum, not the raw passphrase, is passed across the network. A random
passphrase is generated in the suite definition directory when a suite
is registered, but you can create your own if you wish.

For ssh task messaging and user command re-invocation, on the other
hand, the suite passphrase is only required on the suite host account
but ssh keys must be installed for passwordless connections instead.

\subsubsection{Suite Pyro Passphrase Locations}
\label{passphrases}

Suite passphrases currently have to be installed manually to all task
host accounts that use the Pyro communication method (see above); and
also to accounts used to run commands that interact directly with the
suite via Pyro.

Legal passphrase locations, in order of preference, are:
\begin{myenumerate}
    \item \lstinline=$CYLC_SUITE_DEF_PATH/passphrase=
    \item \lstinline=$HOME/.cylc/SUITE_HOST/SUITE_OWNER/SUITE_NAME/passphrase=
    \item \lstinline=$HOME/.cylc/SUITE_HOST/SUITE_NAME/passphrase=
    \item \lstinline=$HOME/.cylc/SUITE_NAME/passphrase=
\end{myenumerate}
Remote tasks know the location of the remote suite definition directory
(if one exists) through their execution environment. Local (suite host)
user command invocations can find the suite definition directory in the
suite name database. Remote user command invocations, however,
cannot interrogate the database on the command host because the suite
will not be registered there (cylc cannot assume that the command host
shares a common filesystem with the suite host). Consequently remote
command host accounts must have the suite passphrase installed in one of
the secondary locations under \lstinline=$HOME/.cylc/=.


\subsection{How Tasks Get Access To Cylc}
\label{HowTasksGetAccessToCylc}

Running tasks need access to cylc via \lstinline=$PATH=, principally for
the task messaging commands.  To allow this, the first thing a task job
script does is set \lstinline=$CYLC_VERSION= to the cylc version number of the
running suite. If you need to run several suites at once under different
incompatible versions of cylc, check that your site is using the cylc
version wrapper (see \lstinline=INSTALL= and \lstinline=admin/cylc-wrapper= in
a cylc installation) then set \lstinline=$CYLC_VERSION= to the desired
version. In the case of developers wishing to run their own copy
of cylc rather than a centrally installed one, set \lstinline=$CYLC_HOME=
to point to your cylc copy.

\subsection{Restarting Suites}
\label{RestartingSuites}

A restarted suite (see \lstinline=cylc restart --help=) is initialized
from a previous recorded suite state dump so that it can carry on from
wherever it got to before being shut down or killed.

Tasks that were recorded in the submitted or running states are now
automatically polled on restart, to see if they are still submitted
(e.g. waiting in a PBS batch queue or similar), still running, or if they
finished (succeeded or failed) while the suite was down.

Tasks recorded in the failed state at shutdown are not automatically
resubmitted on restarting the suite, in case the underlying problem has
not been addressed yet.

\subsection{Task States}

As a suite runs its task proxies transition through the following states:

\begin{myitemize}
    \item {\bf waiting} - task prerequisites not satisfied yet
    (clock-triggered tasks also wait on their trigger time).

    \item {\bf held} - task waiting, but will not be submitted even if ready
    to run because it (and possibly the suite as a whole) has been put
    on hold. Cylc automatically holds tasks that spawn past the final
    cycle time, if one is set.

    \item {\bf runahead} - task waiting, but will not be submitted
    even if ready to run because it has exceeded the {\em suite
    runahead limit}, i.e.\ it has got too far ahead of the slowest tasks
    and will be held back until they have caught up sufficiently. The
    size of the runahead limit is configurable - see
    Section~\ref{RunaheadLimit}.

    \item {\bf queued} - task ready to run (prerequisites satisfied) but
    is temporarily held in an {\em internal cylc queue} (see
    Section~\ref{InternalQueues}). Note this is not the same as the
    `submitted' state below.

    \item {\bf ready} - task ready to run (prerequisites satisfied)
    and handed to the background thread that handles job submission.

    \item {\bf submitted} - task successfully submitted but has not
    started running yet (e.g.\ waiting in a PBS batch queue).

    \item {\bf submit-failed} - task job submission failed {\em or} the
    submitted job was killed before it could start executing.

    \item {\bf running} - task currently executing (a {\em task started}
    message was received, or the task polled as running).

    \item {\bf succeeded} - task finished successsfully (a {\em task
    succeeded} message was received, or the task polled as succeeeded).
    Succeeded task proxies are removed from the suite once they are no
    longer needed to satisfy the prerequisites of others.

    \item {\bf failed} - task aborted due to some error condition (a
    {\em task failed} message was received, or the task polled as failed).
    Failed task proxies are not automatically removed from the suite
    unless by deliberate use of suicide triggers.

    \item {\bf retrying} - task job submission or execution failed, but
    a retry was configured (submission or execution retries, respectively)
    so the task is currently waiting for the configured retry delay
    before resubmitting. See Section~\ref{TaskRetries}. Tasks only enter
    the `submit-failed' or `failed' states if all configured retries
    are exhausted.

\end{myitemize}

Note that greyed-out ``base graph nodes'' in the gcylc graph view do not
represent task states; they are displayed to fill out the graph
structure where corresponding task proxies do not currently exist
in the live task pool.

For manual task state reset purposes {\bf ready} is a pseudo-state that means
{\em waiting} with all prerequisites satisfied.


\subsection{Remote Control - Passphrases and Network Ports}
\label{RemoteControl}

Connecting to a running suite requires knowing the {\em network port} it
is listening on, and the {\em suite passphrase} to authenticate with once
a connection is made to the port.

Suites write their port number to \lstinline=$HOME/.cylc/ports/<SUITE>=
at start-up, and suite-connecting commands read this file to get the
number.\footnote{If you accidentally delete a port file while a suite
is running, use \lstinline=cylc scan= to determine the port number
then use it on the command line (\lstinline=--port=) or rewrite the port
file manually.} An exception to this is the messaging commands called by
tasks. Running tasks know the port number from the execution environment
provided by the suite (via the task job script).

So, to connect to a suite running on another account you must install
the suite passphrase (Section~\ref{passphrases}), and configure
passwordless ssh so that the port number can be retrieved from the
remote port file. Then use the \lstinline=--user= and
\lstinline=--host= command options to connect:
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc monitor --user=USER --host=HOST SUITE
\end{lstlisting}
If you know the port number of the target suite, give it on the command
line to prevent the port-retrieving ssh connection being attempted:
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc monitor --user=USER --host=HOST --port=PORT SUITE
\end{lstlisting}

Possession of a suite passphrase gives full control over the suite, and
ssh access to the port file also implies full access to the suite host
account, so it is recommended that this only be used to interact with
your own suites running on other hosts. We plan to implement
finer-grained authentication in the future to allow suite owners to
grant read-only access to others.


\subsection{Ensemble Suites, Job Submission, and Network Timeouts}
\label{MaxSimJobSub}

\subsubsection{Parallel Submission Of Jobs Ready At The Same Time}

Cylc now handles task job submission in a dedicated worker thread so
that submission of many remote tasks at once does not impact cylc's
performance or responsiveness.

Further, for maximum efficiency, job submissions are batched inside the
worker thread: batch members are submitted in parallel, and all members
must complete (the job submission process, that is, not the submitted
task) before the next batch is handled. There is a configurable delay
between batches to avoid swamping the host system in the event that
hundreds of tasks become ready at the same time:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[cylc]
    [[job submission]]
        batch size = 50 # default 10
        delay between batches = 10 # seconds, default 0
\end{lstlisting}
Here a 120 task ensemble, for example, would be submitted in two batches
of 50 followed by one of 20, with a 10 second delay between batches.

\subsubsection{Network Connection Timeouts}

A connection timeout can be set in site and user config files (see
Section~\ref{SiteAndUserConfiguration}) so that messaging commands
cannot hang indefinitely if the suite is not responding (thie can be
caused by suspending a suite with Ctrl-Z) thereby preventing the task
from completing. The same can be done on the command line for other
suite-connecting user commands, with the \lstinline=--pyro-timeout= option.

\subsection{Internal Queues And The Runahead Limit}

Some cylc suites have the potential to generate too much activity at
once by virtue of the fact that each task cycles independently
constrained only by dependence on other tasks or by clock triggers.
Quick-running tasks at the top of the dependency tree with no
prerequisites and no clock-triggers (or when running far behind the
clock) will spawn rapidly into the future if not constrained somehow.
There are two issues to be aware of here: over-burdening task host
resources by submitting too many tasks at once, and over-burdening cylc
itself by letting the task pool become too big (when fast tasks spawn
ahead of the pack cylc has to keep them around in the {\em succeeded}
state until other tasks, which may depend on them, have caught up).

\subsubsection{The Suite Runahead Limit}
\label{RunaheadLimit}

The runahead limit prevents the fastest tasks in a suite from getting too
far ahead of the slowest ones. Cylc's cycle-interleaving abilities make
for generally efficient scheduling, but there is no great advantage in
letting a few fast data retrieval tasks, say, get far ahead of the
slower tasks because it is typically the tasks at the bottom of the
dependency tree, which necessarily run last, that generate the final
products.

\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    runahead limit = 48 # hours
\end{lstlisting}

A cycling task spawns its successor when it enters the submitted state.
If a newly spawned task's cycle time is ahead of the oldest non-finished
(succeeded or failed) task by more than the runahead limit it is put
into the special {\em runahead} held state until other tasks catch up
sufficiently; i.e.\ the runahead limit constrains the number of cycles
that can run at once.

The default runahead limit is normally set to twice the minimum cycling
interval in the suite. For a suite with 1- and 24-hourly cylcing tasks
the default limit will be 2 hours, so that two of the hourly cycles can
run at once in between the 24-hourly cycles.  If there are any future
triggers present (\lstinline@graph = "foo[T+24] => bar"@) that extend
beyond the default limit, it is adjusted up to equal the future
offset plus one minimum cycling interval.

A manually set runahead limit should not stall the suite even if set to
less than the minimum cycling interval, unless it does not extend out
past any future triggers (see Section~\ref{IntercycleTriggers}.

Succeeded and failed tasks are ignored when applying the runahead limit
(but tasks that can't run because they depend on a failed task are not
ignored, of course).

\subsubsection{Internal Queues}
\label{InternalQueues}

Large suites could potentially swamp the task host hardware or external
batch queueing system, depending on the chosen job submission method, by
submitting too many tasks at once. Cylc's internal queues prevent this
by limiting the number of tasks, within defined groups, that are active
(submitted or running) at once.

A queue is defined by a name; a {\em limit}, which is the maximum
number of active tasks allowed for the queue; and a list of member tasks,
which are assigned by name to the queue.

Queue configuration is done under the [scheduling] section of the
suite.rc file, not as part of the runtime namespace hierarchy, because
like dependencies queues constrain {\em when} a task runs rather than
{\em what} runs after it is submitted. When runtime family relationships
and queues do coincide you can assign task family members en masse to
queues by using the family name, as shown in the example suite listing
below.

By default every task is assigned to a {\em default} queue, which by
default has a zero limit (interpreted by cylc as no limit). To use a
single queue for the whole suite just set the default queue
limit:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[ queues]]
        # limit the entire suite to 5 active tasks at once
        [[[default]]]
            limit = 5
\end{lstlisting}
To use other queues just name each one, set the limit, and assign member
tasks:
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[ queues]]
        [[[q_foo]]]
            limit = 5
            members = foo, bar, baz
\end{lstlisting}
Any tasks not assigned to a particular queue will remain in the default
queue. The {\em queues} example suite illustrates how queues work by
running two task trees side by side (as seen in the graph GUI) each
limited to 2 and 3 tasks respectively:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\lstinputlisting{../examples/queues/suite.rc}
Note assignment of runtime task family members to queues using the
family name.

\subsection{Automatic Task Retry On Failure}
\label{TaskRetries}

See also Section~\ref{RefRetries} in the {\em Suite.rc Reference}.

Tasks can be configured with a list of ``retry delay'' periods, in
minutes, such that if a task fails it will go into a temporary
{\em retrying} state and then automatically resubmit itself after
the next specified delay period expires. A usage example is shown in the
suite listed below under {\em Suite And Task Event Handling},
Section~\ref{EventHandling}.

\subsection{Suite And Task Event Handling}
\label{EventHandling}

See also Sections~\ref{SuiteEventHandling} and~\ref{TaskEventHandling}
in the {\em Suite.rc Reference}.

Cylc can call nominated event handlers when certain suite or task events
occur. This is intended to facilitate centralized alerting and automated
handling of critical events. Event handlers can send an email or an SMS,
call a pager, and so on; or intervene in the operation of their own
suite using cylc commands.  \lstinline=cylc [hook] email-suite= and
\lstinline=cylc [hook] email-task= are example event handlers packaged
with cylc.

Event handlers can be located in the suite bin directory, otherwise
it is up to you to ensure their location is in \lstinline=$PATH=
(in the shell in which cylc runs, on the suite host).

Task event handlers are passed the following arguments by cylc:

\begin{lstlisting}
<task-event-handler> EVENT SUITE TASKID MESSAGE
\end{lstlisting}
where EVENT is one of the following:

\begin{myitemize}
    \item `submitted' - the job submit command was successful
    \item `submission failed' - the job submit command failed
    \item `submission timeout' - task job submission timed out
    \item `submission retry' - task job submission failed, but will retry after a configured delay
    \item `started' - the task reported commencement of execution
    \item `succeeded' - the task reported successful completion
    \item `warning' - the task reported a warning message
    \item `failed' - the task failed
    \item `retry' - the task failed but will retry
    \item `execution timeout' - task execution timed out
\end{myitemize}
MESSAGE, if provided, describes what has happened, and TASKID identifies
the task (\lstinline=NAME.CYCLE= for cycling tasks).

The retry event occurs if a task fails and has any remaining retries
configured (see Section~\ref{TaskRetries}).
The event handler will be called as soon as the task fails, not after
the retry delay period when it is resubmitted.

{\em Note that event handlers are called by cylc itself, not by the
running tasks} so if you wish to pass them additional information via
the environment you must use [cylc] $\rightarrow$ [[environment]],
not task runtime environments.

Here is an example suite that tests the {\em retry} and {\em failed} events.
The handler in this case simply echoes its command line arguments to
suite stdout.

\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    initial cycle time = 2010080800
    final cycle time = 2010081000
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[0]]]
            graph = "foo => bar"
[runtime]
    [[foo]]
        retry delays = 0, 0.5
        command scripting = """
echo TRY NUMBER: $CYLC_TASK_TRY_NUMBER
sleep 10
# retry twice and succeed on the final try,
# but fail definitively in the final cycle.
if (( CYLC_TASK_TRY_NUMBER <= 2 )) || \
    (( CYLC_TASK_CYCLE_TIME == CYLC_SUITE_FINAL_CYCLE_TIME )); then
    echo ABORTING
    /bin/false
fi"""
        [[[event hooks]]]
            retry handler = "echo !!!!!EVENT!!!!! "
            failed handler = "echo !!!!!EVENT!!!!! "
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Reloading The Suite Definition At Runtime}

The \lstinline=cylc reload= command reloads the suite definition at run
time. This allows:
 (a) changing task config such as command scripting or environment;
 (b) adding tasks to, or removing them from, the suite definition,
at run time - without shutting the suite down and restarting it. (It is
easy to shut down and restart cylc suites, but reloading may be useful
if you don't want to wait for long-running tasks to finish first).

Note that {\em defined tasks} can be already be added to or removed from
a running suite with the 'cylc insert' and 'cylc remove' commands; the
reload command allows addition and removal of {\em task definitions}.
If a new task is definition is added (and used in the graph) you will
still need to manually insert an instance of it (with a particular cycle
time) into the running suite. If a task definition (and its use in
the graph) is deleted, existing task proxies of the of the deleted type
will run their course after the reload but new instances will not be
spawned. Changes to a task definition will only take effect when the
next task instance is spawned (existing instances will not be affected).


\subsection{Handling Job Preemption}
\label{PreemptionHPC}

Some HPC facilities allow job preemption: the resource manager can kill
or suspend running low priority jobs in order to make way for high
priority jobs. The preempted jobs may then be automatically restarted
by the resource manager, from the same point (if suspended) or requeued
to run again from the start (if killed). If a running cylc task gets
suspended or hard-killed
(\lstinline=kill -9 <PID>= is not a trappable signal so cylc cannot detect
task failure in this case) and then later restarted, it will just appear
to cylc as if it takes longer than normal to run. If the job is
soft-killed the signal will be trapped by the task job script and a
failure message sent, resulting in cylc putting the task into the failed
state.  When the preempted task restarts and sends its started message
cylc would normally treat this as an error condition (a dead task is not
supposed to be sending messages) - a warning will be logged and the task
will remain in the failed state. However, if you know that preemption is
possible on your system you can tell cylc that affected tasks should be
resurrected from the dead, to carry on as normal if progress messages
start coming in again after a failure:

\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
# ...
[runtime]
    [[on_HPC]]
        enable resurrection = True
    [[TaskFoo]]
        inherit = on_HPC
# ...
\end{lstlisting}

To test this in any suite, manually kill a running task then, after cylc
registers the task failed, resubmit the killed job manually by
cutting-and-pasting the original job submission command from the suite
stdout stream.

\subsection{Runtime Settings Broadcast and Communication Between Tasks}

The \lstinline=cylc broadcast= command overrides \lstinline=[runtime]=
settings in a running suite. This can
be used to communicate information to downstream tasks by broadcasting
environment variables (communication of information from one task to
another normally takes place via the filesystem, i.e.\ the input/output
file relationships embodied in inter-task dependencies). Variables (and
any other runtime settings) may be broadcast to all subsequent tasks,
or targetted specifically at a specific task, all subsequent tasks with a
given name, or all tasks with a given cycle time; see broadcast command
help for details.

Broadcast settings targetted at a specific task ID or cycle time expire
and are forgotten as the suite moves on. Untargetted variables and those
targetted at a task name persist throughout the suite run, even across
restarts, unless manually cleared using the broadcast command - and so
should be used sparingly.

\subsection{The Meaning And Use Of Initial Cycle Time}

When a suite is started with the \lstinline=cylc run= command (cold or
warm start) the cycle time at which it starts can be given on the
command line or hardwired into the suite.rc file:
\begin{lstlisting}
cylc run foo 2012080806
\end{lstlisting}
or,
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    initial cycle time = 2010080806
\end{lstlisting}
An initial cycle time given on the command line will override one in the
suite.rc file.

\subsubsection[CYLC\_SUITE\_INITIAL\_CYCLE\_TIME]{The Environment Variable CYLC\_SUITE\_INITIAL\_CYCLE\_TIME}

In the case of {\em cold starts only} the initial cycle time will also
be passed through to task execution environments as
\lstinline=$CYLC_SUITE_INITIAL_CYCLE_TIME=.  The intended use of this
variable is to allow tasks to determine whether they are running in the
initial cold-start cycle (when different behaviour may be required) or
in a normal mid-run cycle. {\em This is not done for warm starts}
because a warm start is really an implicit restart - it does not
reference a particular previous suite state but it does assume that a
previous cycle (for each task) has been run and completed entirely.
It follows that in a warm start tasks are really in a normal mid-run
cycle, and because no actual previous state is referenced
\lstinline=$CYLC_SUITE_INITIAL_CYCLE_TIME= gets the value
\lstinline=None=. After a cold-start, however, the value of the
environment variable does persist across restarts because the original
cold-start cycle time is stored in suite state dump files.


\subsection{The Simulation And Dummy Run Modes}
\label{SimulationMode}

Since cylc-4.6.0 any cylc suite can run in {\em live}, {\em simulation},
or {\em dummy} mode.  Prior to that release simulation mode was a
hybrid mode that replaced real tasks with local dummy tasks. This
allowed local simulation testing of any suite, to get the scheduling
right without running real tasks, but running dummy tasks locally does
not add much value over a pure simulation (in which no tasks are
submitted at all) because all job submission configuration has to be
ignored and most task job script sections have to be cut out to avoid
any code that could potentially be specific to the intended task host.
So at 4.6.0 we replaced this with a pure simulation mode (task proxies
go through the {\em running} state automatically within cylc, and no
dummy tasks are submitted to run) and a new dummy mode in which only the
real task command scripting  is dummied out - each dummy task is
submitted exactly as the task it represents on the correct host and in
the same execution environment. A successful dummy run confirms not only
that the scheduling works correctly but also tests real job submission,
communication from remote task hosts, and the real task job scripts (in
which errors such as use of undefined variables will cause a task to
fail).

The run mode, which defaults to {\em live}, is set on the command line
(for run and restart):
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc run --mode=dummy SUITE
\end{lstlisting}
but you can configure the suite to force a particular run mode,
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[cylc]
    force run mode = simulation
\end{lstlisting}
This can be used, for example, for demo suites that necessarily run out
of their original context; or to temporarily prevent accidental
execution of expensive real tasks during suite development.

Dummy mode task command scripting just prints a message and sleeps for ten
seconds by default, but you can override this behaviour for particular
tasks or task groups if you like. Here's how to make a task sleep for
twenty seconds and then fail in dummy mode:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[runtime]
    [[foo]]
        command scripting = "run-real-task.sh"
        [[[dummy mode]]]
            command scripting = """
echo "hello from dummy task $CYLC_TASK_ID"
sleep 20
echo "ABORTING"
/bin/false"""
\end{lstlisting}

Finally, in simulation mode each task takes between 1 and 15 seconds to
``run'' by default, but you can also alter this for particular tasks or
groups of tasks:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[runtime]
    [[foo]]
        run time range = 20,31 # (between 20 and 30 seconds)
        command scripting = "echo ABORTING; /bin/false" # fail in dummy mode
\end{lstlisting}
Note that to get a failed simulation or dummy mode task to succeed on
re-triggering, just change the suite.rc file appropriately and reload
the suite definition at run time with \lstinline=cylc reload SUITE=
before re-triggering the task.

Dummy mode is equivalent to commenting out each task's command scripting
to expose the default scripting.

\subsubsection{The Non-live-mode Accelerated Clock}

In simulation and dummy mode cylc uses an accelerated clock with
configurable rate and offset relative to the suite's initial cycle time.
This affects the trigger time of any clock-triggered tasks in the suite,
and the length of time between cycles if simulating ``caught up''
operation (without this a six-hour cycling suite, for instance, would
wait six hours between cycles when simulating caught-up operation, even
though the simulated or dummy tasks run very quickly). By configuring
the initial clock offset you can quickly simulate how suites catch up
and transition from delayed to real time operation.

See Section~\ref{ClockConfig} for accelerated clock configuration
settings.

\subsubsection{Restarting Suites With A Different Run Mode?}

The run mode is recorded in the suite state dump file. Cylc will not let
you {\em restart} a non-live mode suite in live mode, or vice versa -
any attempt to do the former would certainly be a mistake (because the
simulation mode dummy tasks do not generate any of the real outputs
depended on by downstream live tasks), and the latter, while feasible,
would corrupt the live state dump by turning it over to simulation mode.
The easiest way to test a live suite in simulation mode, if you don't
want to obliterate the current state dump by doing a cold or warm start
(as opposed to a restart from the previous state) is to take a quick
copy of the suite and run the copy in simulation mode. However, if you
really want to run a live suite forward in simulation mode without
copying it, do this:
\begin{myenumerate}
    \item Back up the live mode suite state dump file.
    \item Edit the mode line in the state dump and restart in simulation mode.
    \item Later, restart the live suite from the restored live state dump back up.
\end{myenumerate}

%{\em Finally, it should be noted that cylc previously had the ability to
%create an instant safe simulation mode clone of the current state of any
%suite, running or stopped, but this ``practice mode'' has been disabled
%since the upgrade to cylc-3, pending testing; it could easily be
%restored if needed.}

%\subsubsection{Practice Mode}
%
%Practice mode allows quick and easy testing of potentially complex
%suite interventions, with complete safety.
%
%\begin{lstlisting}
%cylc restart --practice examples:CUG_1
%\end{lstlisting}
%
%This will start a simulation mode clone of an existing suite from the
%current state of that suite (which may be paused, still running, or
%halted), but using different state and log files so that the original
%suite will not be corrupted by the clone.
%
%{\em At start-up in practice mode, failed tasks are not reset to waiting}
%because the whole point of practice mode is to ``practice'' how to
%recover from failures.
%
%Note that other cylc commands for monitoring or interacting with the
%suite must also use the \lstinline=--practice= option in order to
%target the practice suite and not the real one. Be sure to set
%\lstinline=cylc lock= on the original suite first, to avoid
%accidentally messing with it (even if you do screw up, however, cylc's
%automatic pre-intervention state dumps will save you!).
%
%
%\subsubsection{Roll Your Own Practice Mode}
%
%A less automated way to ``practice'' on a copy of an existing suite
%that starts up from the current (or previous) state of that suite,
%\lstinline=cylc run --practice= is this:
%
%\begin{myitemize}
%    \item register your suite again under a different name. This allows
%        you to run a simulation mode copy of the same suite without
%        interfering with the original suite (it also allows you to run
%        a copy of the live mode suite without interference, but only if
%        the real suite tasks are configured to use the registered
%        suite name in all important input and output filenames and/or
%        directory paths - see {\em Command Reference} Section~\ref{register}).
%
%    \item start-up the newly registered suite in simulation mode using:
%        \begin{lstlisting}
%cylc restart --simulation-mode SUITE PATH
%        \end{lstlisting}
%        where PATH is a state dump file from the original suite. The
%        absolute path is required here because the default state
%        dump location depends on the registered suite name (so that
%        different suites don't interfere with each other's state
%        dumps).
%
%\end{myitemize}
%

%\section{Network Issues}
%
%Cylc can control tasks on a distributed system (multiple hosts).  If you
%do have a distributed suite, in any or all of these ways, be aware of
%the following issues:
%
%\begin{myitemize}
%
%    \item In addition to the cylc host, cylc must be installed on all
%        task hosts; and the remote task scripts must
%        themselves be installed on their host machines.  Refer to {\em
%        Running Tasks On A Remote Host}
%        (Section~\ref{RunningTasksOnARemoteHost}) for more on this.
%
%    \item Pyro must be installed on every host used by the suite.
%         Ideally all relevant machines should have the same version of
%         Pyro, but you can easily check for Pyro version
%         compatibility by attempting to run one of the cylc example
%         system.
%
%\end{myitemize}
%
%Other notes relevant to the last point above: the \lstinline=--host=
%cylc command option defaults to Python \lstinline=socket.getfqdn()=,
%which retrieves the fully qualified domain name of the local host
%if possible.  But \lstinline=/etc/hosts= may cause this to return
%just the hostname, which locally may resolve to the local-only IP
%address that is not accessible on the network.  Short of reconfiguring
%the hosts file, you may be able to workaround these problems by:
%
%\begin{myitemize}
%
%    \item and, get cylc to configure the Pyro daemon
%        with \lstinline@Pyro.config.PYRO_DNS_URI = True@
%
%    \item and, use the \lstinline=--host= cylc command option where
%        required.
%
%\end{myitemize}


\subsection{Automated Reference Test Suites}
\label{AutoRefTests}

Reference tests are finite-duration suite runs that abort with non-zero
exit status if any of the following conditions occur (by default):

\begin{myitemize}
    \item cylc fails
    \item any task fails
    \item the suite times out (e.g.\ a task dies without reporting failure)
    \item a nominated shutdown event handler exits with error status
\end{myitemize}

The default shutdown event handler for reference tests is
\lstinline=cylc hook check-triggering= which compares task triggering
information (what triggers off what at run time) in the test run suite
log to that from an earlier reference run, disregarding the timing and
order of events - which can vary according to the external queueing
conditions, runahead limit, and so on.

To prepare a reference log for a suite, run it with the
\lstinline=--reference-log= option, and manually verify the
correctness of the reference run.

To reference test a suite, just run it (in dummy mode for the most
comprehensive test without running real tasks) with the
\lstinline=--reference-test= option.

A battery of automated reference tests is used to test cylc before
posting a new release version.  Reference tests can also be used at cylc
upgrade time to check that the upgrade will not break your own complex
suites - the triggering check will catch any bug that causes a task to
run when it shouldn't, for instance; even in a dummy mode reference
test the full task job script (sans real command scripting) has to
execute successfully on the proper task host by the proper job
submission method.

Reference tests can be configured with the following settings:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[cylc]
    [[reference test]]
        suite shutdown event handler = cylc check-triggering
        required run mode = dummy
        allow task failures = False
        live mode suite timeout = 5 # minutes
        dummy mode suite timeout = 2
        simulation mode suite timeout = 2
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Roll-your-own Reference Tests}

If the default reference test is not sufficient for your needs, firstly
note that you can override the default shutdown event handler, and
secondly that the \lstinline=--reference-test= option is merely a short
cut to the following suite.rc settings which can also be set manually if
you wish:

\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[cylc]
    abort if any task fails = True
    [[event hooks]]
        shutdown handler = cylc check-triggering
        timeout = 5
        abort if shutdown handler fails = True
        abort on timeout = True
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Triggering Off Tasks In Other Suites}
\label{SuiteStatePolling}

The \lstinline=cylc suite-state= command, which interrogates suite run
databases, has a polling mode that waits on a given task achieving a
given state.  See \lstinline=cylc suite-state --help= for command
options and defaults.

The suite graph notation also allows you to define local tasks that, in
effect, represent tasks in other suites by automatically polling for
them using the \lstinline=cylc suite-state= command. Here's how to
trigger a task \lstinline=bar= off a task \lstinline=foo= in another
suite called \lstinline=other.suite=:
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[ dependencies]]
        [[[0,12]]]
            graph = "FOO<other.suite::foo> => bar"
\end{lstlisting}
Local task \lstinline=FOO= will poll for the success of \lstinline=foo=
in suite \lstinline=other.suite= at the same cycle time. Other task
states can be polled like this,
\begin{lstlisting}
   graph = "FOO<other.suite::foo:fail> => bar"
\end{lstlisting}

Default polling parameters (the maximum number of polls and the interval
between them) are printed by \lstinline=cylc suite-state --help=.
These can be configured if necessary under the local polling task
runtime section:
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[ dependencies]]
        [[[0,12]]]
            graph = "FOO<other.suite::foo> => bar"
[runtime]
    [[FOO]]
        [[[suite state polling]]]
            max-polls = 100
            interval = 10 # seconds
\end{lstlisting}

The remote suite does not have to be running when polling commences (or
at all if the remote condition has already been achieved) because the
command interrogates the suite run database, not the suite server
process.

For suites owned by others or those with run databases in non-standard
locations use the \lstinline=--run-dir= option or, in-suite,
\begin{lstlisting}
[runtime]
    [[FOO]]
        [[[suite state polling]]]
            run-dir = /path/to/top/level/cylc/run-directory
\end{lstlisting}

To trigger off remote tasks with different cycle times just arrange for
the local polling task to be on the same cycling sequence as the remote
task that it represents. For instance, if local task \lstinline=cat=
cycles 6-hourly at \lstinline=0,6,12,18= but needs to trigger off a
remote task \lstinline=dog= with cycle times of \lstinline=3,9,15,21=
hours,
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[ dependencies]]
        [[[0,6,12,18]]]
            graph = "DOG<other.suite::dog>[T-3] => cat"
\end{lstlisting}
This results in \lstinline=DOG= having cycle times of
\lstinline=3,9,15,21= - the sames as \lstinline=dog= in
\lstinline=other.suite=.


\section{Other Topics In Brief}

The following topics have yet to be documented in detail.

\begin{myitemize}
    \item The difference between cold-, warm-, raw-, and re-starting, a suite:
        see \lstinline=cylc run help=.

    \item Intervening in suites, e.g.\ stopping, removing, inserting tasks:
        see \lstinline=cylc control help=.

    \item Interrogating suites and tasks:
        see \lstinline=cylc info help=, \lstinline=cylc show help=,
        and \lstinline=cylc discovery help=.

    \item Understanding suite evolution, particularly in delayed/catchup
        operation: the Tutorial helps here (Section~\ref{Tutorial}),
        along with running the example suites.

    \item Automatic state dump backups, named pre-intervention state dumps:
        these are used to resetart a suite from a previous state of operation.
        They are mentioned in the Tutorial (Section~\ref{Tutorial}). Watch the
        suite log after intervening in a suite, to get the filename.

    \item Recursive purge: this is a powerful intervention but you need
        to understand how it works before using it. See
        \lstinline=cylc purge help= for details.

    \item Handling spin-up processes via temporary tasks and adding
        prerequisites on-the-fly: see \lstinline=cylc depend --help=,
        and note that when you insert a task into a running suite (a)
        the initial cycle time can be in the past; and (b) you can give
        a final cycle time after which the task will be eliminated from
        the suite.

    % \item How to recover from certain kinds of task failure.
    %\item instant simulation mode clones of a running suite
    %\item fuzzy prerequisites - triggering of the {\em most recent available},
    %    within limits, instance of an upstream task

    \item Sub-suites: to run another suite inside a task, just invoke the
        subsuite, with appropriate start and end cycles (probably a
        single cycle), in the host task's command scripting:

\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[runtime]
    [[foo]]
        command scripting = \
        "cylc run SUITE $CYLC_TASK_CYCLE_TIME --until=$CYLC_TASK_CYCLE_TIME"
\end{lstlisting}

\end{myitemize}
\lstset{language=transcript}

\section{Suite Storage, Discovery, Revision Control, and Deployment}
\label{SuiteStorageEtc}

Small groups of cylc users can of course share suites by manual copying,
and generic revision control tools can be used on cylc suites as for any
collection of files. Beyond this cylc does not have a built-in solution
for suite storage and discovery, revision control, and deployment, on a
network. That is not cylc's core purpose, and large sites may have
preferred revision control systems and suite meta-data requirements that
are difficult to anticipate. We can, however, recommend the use of {\em
Rose} to do all of this very easily and elegantly with cylc suites.

\subsection{Rose}
\label{Rose}

{\bf Rose} is {\em a framework for managing and running suites of
scientific applications}, developed at the UK Met Office for use with
cylc. It is available under the open source GPL license.

\end{myitemize}


\section{Suite Design Principles}
\label{SuiteDesignPrinciples}

%Simplicity, flexibility, efficiency, and portability of cylc suites.

\subsection{Make Fine-Grained Suites}
\label{Granularity}

A suite can contain a small number of large, internally complex tasks; a
large number of small, simple tasks; or anything in between. Cylc can
easily handle a large number of tasks, however, so there are definite
advantages to fine-graining:

\begin{myitemize}
    \item a more modular and transparent suite.

    \item better functional parallelism (multiple tasks running
        at the same time).

    \item faster debugging and failure recovery: rerun just the tasks(s)
        that failed.

    \item code reuse: similar tasks can often call the same script or
        command with differing task-specific input parameters
        (consider tasks that move files around, for example).

\end{myitemize}

\subsection{Make Tasks Rerunnable}

It should be possible to rerun a task by simply resubmitting it for the
same cycle time. In other words, failure at any point during execution
of a task should not render a rerun impossible by corrupting the state
of some internal-use file, or whatever. It is difficult to overstate the
usefulness of being able to rerun the same task multiple times,
either outside of the suite with \lstinline=cylc submit=, or by
retriggering it within the running suite, when debugging a problem.

\subsection{Make Models Rerunnable}

If a warm-cycled model simply overwrites its restart files in each
run, the only cycle that can subsequently run is the next one. This
is dangerous because if, accidentally or otherwise, the task runs for the
wrong cycle time, its restart files will be corrupted such that the
correct cycle can no longer run (probably necessitating a cold-start).
Instead, consider organising restart files by cycle time, through a file
or directory naming convention, and keep them in a simple rolling
archive (cylc's filename templating and housekeeping
utilities can easily do this for you). Then, given availability of
external inputs, you can easily rerun the task for any cycle still
in the restart archive.

\subsection{Avoid Unnecessary Previous-Instance Dependence}
\label{LimitPID}

If a cycling task does not generate files required by its own successor,
then for maximum scheduling efficiency successive instances of it should
be able to run in parallel if the opportunity arises.

If such a task would interfere with its own siblings for internal reasons,
however, perhaps by use of a hardwired non cycle time dependent
temporary file or similar, then it can be forced to run sequentially -
see Section~\ref{SequentialTasks}.

\subsection{Put Task Cycle Time In All Output File Paths}
\label{PutCycleTimeinIO}

Putting task cycle time in output file or directory names makes
archiving and cleanup easier, and it facilitates task re-runnability and
avoidance of previous-instance dependence (above) by ensuring that
important files do not get overwritten by the next cycle.

The \lstinline=cylc cycletime= command computes offsets (in hours, days,
months, and years) from a given or current cycle time, and optionally
inserts the resulting computed cycle time, or components of it, into a
given filename template string.

\subsection{How To Manage Input/Output File Dependencies}
\label{HandlingDependencies}

Dependencies between tasks usually, though not always, take the form of
files generated by one task that are used by other tasks. It is possible
to manage these files across a suite without hard wiring I/O locations
and therefore compromising suite flexibility and portability.

\begin{myitemize}

\item {\bf Use A Common I/O Workspace}

For small suites you may be able to have all tasks read and write from a
common workspace, thereby avoiding the need to move common files around.
You should be able to define the workspace location once in the suite.rc
file rather than hard wiring it into the task implementations.

\item {\bf Add Connector Tasks To The Suite}

Tasks can be added to a suite to move files from A's output directory to
B's input directory, and so on.  Many connector tasks may be able
to call the same file transfer script or command, with task-dependendent
input parameters defined in the suite.rc file.

\item {\bf Dynamic Configuration Of I/O Paths}

Whether or not your suite uses a single common workspace, passing common
I/O paths to tasks via variables defined once in the suite.rc file should
allow you to avoid using connector tasks at all, except where it is
necessary to transfer files between machines, or similar.

\end{myitemize}

\subsection{Use Generic Task Scripts}

If your suite contains multiple logically distinct tasks that actually
have similar functionality (e.g.\ for moving files around, or for
generating similar products from the output of several similar models)
have the corresponding cylc tasks all call the same command, script, or
executable - just provide different input parameters
via the task command scripting and/or execution environment, in the
suite.rc file.


\subsection{Make Suites Portable}

If every task in a suite is configured to put its output under
\lstinline=$HOME= (i.e.\ the environment variable, literally, not the
explicit path to your home directory; and similarly for temporary
directories, etc.) then other users will be able to copy the suite and
run it immediately, after merely ensuring that any external input files
are in the right place.

For the ultimate in portability, construct suites in which all task I/O
paths are dynamically configured to be user and suite (registration)
specific, e.g.
\begin{lstlisting}
$HOME/output/$CYLC_SUITE_REG_PATH
\end{lstlisting}
(these variables are automatically exported to the task execution
environment by cylc - see {\em Task Execution Environment},
Section~\ref{TaskExecutionEnvironment}). Then you can run multiple
instances of the suite
at once (even under the same user account) without changing anything,
and they will not interfere with each other.

{\em You can test changes to a portable suite safely by making a quick copy
of it in a temporary directory, then modifying and running the test copy
without fear of corrupting the output directories, suite logs, and
suite state, of the original.}


\subsection{Make Tasks As Self-Contained As Possible}

Where possible, no task should rely on the action of another task,
except for the prerequisites embodied in the suite dependency graph that
it has no choice but to depend on. If this rule is followed, your suite
will be as flexible as possible in terms of being able to run single
tasks, or subsets of the suite, whilst debugging or developing new
features.\footnote{The \lstinline=cylc submit= command runs a single
task exactly as its suite would, in terms of both job submission method
and execution environment.}  For example, every task should create its
own output directories if they do not already exist, instead of assuming
their existence due to the action of some other task; then you will be
able to run single tasks without having to manually create output
directories first.

\begin{lstlisting}
# manual task scripting:
  # 1/ create $OUTDIR if it doesn't already exist:
  mkdir -p $OUTDIR
  # 2/ create the parent directory of $OUTFILE if it doesn't exist:
  mkdir -p $( dirname $OUTFILE )

# OR using the cylc checkvars utility:
  # 1/ check vars are defined, and create directories if necessary:
  cylc util checkvars -c OUTDIR1 OUTDIR2 #...
  # 2/ check vars are defined, and create parent dirs if necessary:
  cylc util checkvars -p OUTFILE1 OUTFILE2 #...
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Make Suites As Self-Contained As Possible}

The only compulsory content of a cylc suite definition directory is the
\lstinline=suite.rc= file. However, you can store whatever you
like in a suite definition directory;\footnote{If you copy a suite using
cylc commands or GUI the entire suite definition directory
will be copied.} other files there will be ignored by cylc but
suite tasks can access them via the
\lstinline=$CYLC_SUITE_DEF_PATH= variable that cylc automatically
exports into the task execution environment. Disk space is cheap - if
all programs, ancillary files, control files (etc.) required by the
suite are stored in the suite
definition directory instead of having the suite reference external
build directories (etc.), you can turn the directory into a revision
control repository and be virtually assured of the ability to exactly
reproduce earlier versions, regardless of suite complexity.

\subsection{Orderly Product Generation?}
\label{OrderlyProductGeneration}

Correct scheduling is not equivalent to ``orderly generation of products
by cycle time''.  Under cylc, a product generation task will trigger as
soon as its prerequisites are satisfied (i.e.\ when its input files are
ready, generally) regardless of whether other tasks with the same cycle
time have finished or have yet to run. If your product delivery or
presentation system demands that all products for one cycle time are
uploaded (or whatever) before any from the next cycle, then be aware
that this may be quite inefficient if your suite is ever faced with
catching up from a significant delay or running over historical data.

If you must, however, you can introduce artificial dependencies into
your suite to ensure that the final products never arrive out of
sequence.  One way of doing this would be to have a final ``product
upload'' task that depends on completion of all the real product
generation tasks at the same cycle time, and then declare it to be
sequential (see Section~\ref{SequentialTasks}.

\subsection{Clock-triggered Tasks Wait On External Data}

All tasks in a cylc suite know their own private cycle time, but most
don't care about the wall clock time - they just run when their
prerequisites are satisfied. The exception to this is {\em
clock-triggered} tasks, which wait on a wall clock time expressed as an
offset from their own cycle time, in addition to any other
prerequisites. The usual purpose of these tasks is to retrieve real time
data from the external world, triggering at roughly the expected time of
availability of the data. Triggering the task at the right time is up to
cylc, but the task itself should go into a check-and-wait loop in case
the data is delayed; only on successful detection or retrieval should
the task report success and then exit (or perhaps report failure and
then exit if the data has not arrived by some cutoff time).

\subsection{Do Not Treat Real Time Operation As Special}

Cylc suites, without modification, can handle real time and delayed
operation equally well.

In real time operation clock-triggered tasks constrain the
behaviour of the whole suite, or at least of all tasks
downstream of them in the dependency graph.

In delayed operation (whether due to an actual delay in an operational
suite or because you're running an historical trial) clock-triggered
tasks will not constrain the suite at all, and cylc's cycle interleaving
abilities come to the fore, because their trigger times have already
passed.  But if a clock-triggered task happens to catch up to the wall
clock, it will automatically wait again. In this way a cylc suite
naturally and seamlessly transitions between delayed and real time
operation as required.


    \subsection{Factor Out Common Configuration}

        Properties shared by multiple tasks (job submission settings,
        environment variables, command scripting, etc.) should ideally
        be defined only once.  Cylc supports several ways of achieving
        this:

        \begin{myitemize}
            \item {\em Multiple inheritance} under \lstinline@[runtime]@
                - shared items can be put into namespaces inherited by
                related tasks.

            \item {\em Jinja2 variables} can be defined once and
                referenced throughout the suite definition.
        \end{myitemize}

        Multiple inheritance is very efficient when tasks share many
        properties. Jinja2 variables are more efficient when single items
        are shared by just a few tasks that don't have anything else in
        common (e.g.\ an environment variable for the location of a
        shared file).

        For environment variables in particular it may be tempting to
        define all variables for all tasks once under
        \lstinline=[root]=, but this is somewhat analagous to overuse of
        global variables in programming and it can make it difficult to
        determine which variables matter to which tasks. Environment
        filters (Section~\ref{EnvironmentFilter}) can be used
        to make this safer, however.

        Finally, Jinja2 can also be used to avoid defining intermediate
        environment variables for the sole purpose of deriving other
        environment variables at task run time. Instead of this:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[runtime]
    [[root]]
        [[[environment]]]
            OUTPUT_DIR=/my/top/outputdir
    [[foo]]
        [[[environment]]]
            FOO_OUTPUT_DIR=$OUTPUT_DIR/foo
            BAR_OUTPUT_DIR=$OUTPUT_DIR/bar
\end{lstlisting}
        do this:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
{% set OUTPUT_DIR = "/my/top/outputdir" %}
[runtime]
    [[foo]]
        [[[environment]]]
            FOO_OUTPUT_DIR={{ OUTPUT_DIR }}/foo
            BAR_OUTPUT_DIR={{ OUTPUT_DIR }}/bar
\end{lstlisting}

        If the values of these Jinja2 variables are needed in external
        scripts, just translate them directly in environment sections:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
    [[[environment]]]
        OUTPUT_DIR = {{ OUTPUT_DIR }}
\end{lstlisting}


      \subsection{Use The Graph For Scheduling}

          If you find yourself writing runtime scripting to get a task
          to change its behaviour significantly from one cycle to the
          next, consider that the graph is usually the proper place
          to express this sort of thing. Use different task names, but
          have them inherit common properties from a family namespace to
          avoid duplication.  Instead of this:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[0,6,12,18]]]
            graph = "foo => bar => baz"
[runtime]
    [[bar]]
        command scripting = """
if [[ $( cylc cycletime --print-hour ) == 06 || \
      $( cylc cycletime --print-hour ) == 18 ]]; then
    SENTENCE="the quick brown fox"
else
    SENTENCE="the lazy dog"
fi
echo $SENTENCE"""
        # (...other config...)
\end{lstlisting}
        do this:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[0,12]]]
            graph = "foo => bar_a => baz"
        [[[6,18]]]
            graph = "foo => bar_b => baz"
[runtime]
    [[BAR]]
        # (... other config...)
        command scripting = "echo $SENTENCE"
    [[bar_a]]
        inherit = BAR
        [[[environment]]]
            SENTENCE = "the quick brown fox"
    [[bar_b]]
        inherit = BAR
        [[[environment]]]
            SENTENCE = "the lazy dog"
\end{lstlisting}

        \subsection{Use Suite Visualization}

    Effective visualization can make complex suites easier to
    understand. Collapsible task families for visualization are defined
    by the {\em first parents} in the runtime namespace hierarchy. Tasks
    should generally be grouped into visualization families that reflect their purpose
    within the structure of the suite rather than technical detail
    such as common job submission method or task host. This often coincides
    nicely with common configuration inheritance requirements, but if it
    doesn't you can use an empty namespace as a first parent for
    visualization:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[runtime]
    [[OBSPROC]]
    [[obs1, obs2, obs3]]
        inherit = OBSPROC
\end{lstlisting}
    and you can demote parents from primary to secondary:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[runtime]
    [[HOSTX]]
        # common settings for tasks on host HOSTX
    [[foo]]
        inherit = None, HOSTX
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Style Guide}

Good style is arguably just a matter of taste.  That said, for
collaborative development of complex systems it is important to settle
on a clear and consistent style. You may find the following suggestions
useful.

\subsection{Line Indentation}

The suite.rc file format consists of \lstinline@item = value@ pairs
under nested section headings. Clear indentation is the best way to show
local nesting level inside large blocks.

\begin{myitemize}
    \item Indent suite.rc syntax four spaces per nesting level.

\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[SECTION]
    title = the quick brown fox
    [[SUBSECTION]]
        a short item = value1
        a very very long item = value2
\end{lstlisting}
    Don't align \lstinline@item = value@ pairs on the \lstinline@=@ character:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[SECTION]
             a short item = value1
    a very very long item = value2
\end{lstlisting}
    This does not show nesting level clearly, and long items push
    everything off to the right. The following may be acceptable
    though as it preserves proper indentation:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[SECTION]
    a short item          = value1
    a very very long item = value2
\end{lstlisting}

    \item Set your text editor to convert {\em TAB characters} to spaces -
        tabs may be displayed differently in different editors, so a
        mixture of space and tab indentations can render to a mess.

    \item {\em Line comments} should be indented to the same level as the
        section or item they refer to. Consistent local indentation makes
        block re-indentation operations easier in text editors.

    \item  {\em Command scripting strings} are interpreted by the
        associated task job script, not by cylc, so strictly speaking
        their internal lines should not be indented as if part of the
        suite.rc syntax. This, for example,
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[runtime]
    [[foo]]
        command scripting = \
"""echo Hello World!
echo Goodbye World!"""
\end{lstlisting}
is preferred over this (or similar):
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[runtime]
    [[foo]]
        command scripting ="""
            echo Hello World!
            echo Goodbye World!
                           """
\end{lstlisting}
        The extra whitespace here translates directly to spurious
        indentation in the task job script. As it happens this is just
        an aesthetic problem in bash scripts, but for Python job scripts
        (which cylc may support in the future) it would be a technical error.

    \item The positioning of string-delimiting triple quotes is of no
        practical consequence either, but the following forms are
        suggested for the same reason - to avoid including spurious
        whitespace in the string:
\begin{lstlisting}
[runtime]
    [[foo]]
        # best:
        command scripting = \
"""echo Hello World!
echo Goodbye World!"""
        # or (short first line):
        command scripting ="""echo Hello World!
echo Goodbye World!"""
        # or (adds a single extra newline character):
        command scripting ="""
echo Hello World!
echo Goodbye World!"""
\end{lstlisting}

    \item Multiline dependency \lstinline@graph@ strings have no meaning
        outside of the suite definition, so they can be free-form in
        order to most clearly present the structure of the suite:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = """
   foo => bar => baz => qux
     # failure recovery:
     qux:fail => recover
                """
\end{lstlisting}

   \item Embedded {\em Jinja2} code is not part of the suite.rc syntax, so
       it should be indented from the left margin on its own terms.
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
    [[OPS]]
{% for T in OPS_TASKS %}
    [[ops_{{T}}]]
        inherit = OPS
        # ...
{% endfor %}
\end{lstlisting}
   \end{myitemize}

    \subsection{Comments}

    \begin{myitemize}
        \item {\em Indent line comments} to section or item level, as
            described above.

        \item Avoid {\em numbered comments} - future changes can create a
            renumbering nightmare.

        \item Avoid {\em unnecessary comments} - if these are not kept up
            to date with code changes the result is misleading, which is
            worse than having no comments at all.
            If context and clear item or variable names will do, leave
            it at that.

        \item Avoid {\em full page width ``section divider'' comments} -
            these assume a particular line width, which can be a problem
            for text editors that auto line break on a smaller line width.

    \end{myitemize}

    \subsection{Other}

        \begin{myitemize}
         \item Avoid {\em very long lines} if possible - these affect
             readability and may be a problem for auto-line-breaking
             text editors.  Line continuation markers can be used
             anywhere in a suite definition to break up long lines:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = "prep => one => two => three \
            => four => five six => seven => eight"
[runtime]
    [[MY_TASKS]]
    [[one, two, three, four, five, \
        six, seven, eight ]]
        inherit = MY_TASKS
\end{lstlisting}
Graph lines can also be split up without line breaks, like this:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
[scheduling]
    [[dependencies]]
        graph = """prep => one => two => three => four
                   four => five six => seven => eight"""
\end{lstlisting}

            \item Use a {\em naming convention} for runtime namespaces:
                uppercase names for families and lower case for tasks,
                so that you can tell which is which at a glance.

            \item Don't bother writing command scripting that prints
                all task input variables to stdout - there is a
                maintenance cost to this, and for little benefit because
                a task's job script (containing the variable definitions)
                can be view just as easily as its output logs.

        \end{myitemize}

\section{The Cylc Lockserver}
\label{TheCylcLockserver}

Each cylc user can optionally run his/her own lockserver to prevent
accidental invocation of multiple instances of the same suite or task at
the same time. The suite and task locks brokered by the lockserver are
analogous to traditional lock files, but they work across a network,
even for distributed suites containing tasks that start executing on one
host and finish on another.

Accidental invocation of multiple instances
of the same suite or task at the same time can have serious consequences,
so use of the lockserver should be considered for important operational
suites, but it may be considered an unnecessary complication for general
less critical usage, so it is currently disabled by default.

To enable the lockserver:
\lstset{language=suiterc}
\begin{lstlisting}
use lockserver = True
\end{lstlisting}

The suite will now abort at start-up if it cannot connect to the
lockserver.  To start your lockserver daemon,
\lstset{language=transcript}
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc lockserver start
\end{lstlisting}

To check that it is running,
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc lockserver status
\end{lstlisting}

For detailed usage information,
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc lockserver --help
\end{lstlisting}

There is a command line client interface,
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ cylc lockclient --help
\end{lstlisting}
for interrogating the lockserver and managing locks manually (e.g.\
releasing locks if a suite was killed before it could clean up after
itself).

To watch suite locks being acquired and released as a suite runs,
\begin{lstlisting}
shell$ watch cylc lockclient --print
\end{lstlisting}

\section{The gcylc Graph View}
\label{TheGraphBasedcontrolGUI}

The graph view in the gcylc GUI has the advantage that it shows
the structure of a suite very clearly as it evolves. It works remarkably
well even for very large suites (up to several hundred tasks or more)
{\em but} because the graphviz engine does a new global layout every
time the graph changes the layout is often not very stable. This may not
be a solvable problem even in principle as it seems likely that making
continual incremental changes to an existing graph without redoing the
global layout would inevitably result in a horrible mess.

The following features of the graph view, however, help mitigate the the
jumping layout problem:

\begin{myitemize}
    \item The disconnect button can be used to temporarily prevent the
        graph from changing as the content of the suite changes (and
        in real time operation suites evolve quite slowly anyway)
    \item In most suites, toggling the greyed-out ``base graph'' nodes
        (which do not represent current live task proxies and are just
        present to fill out the graph structure) will dramatically
        reduce the size of the graph (but it will split into several
        disconnected sub-trees).
    \item Right-click on a task and choose the ``Focus'' option to restrict
        the graph display to that task's cycle time. Anything interesting
        happening in other cycles will show up as disconnected
        rectangular nodes to the right of the graph (and you can click
        on those to intantly refocus to their cycles).
    \item Task filtering is the ultimate quick route to temporarily focusing
        on just the tasks you're interested in (but this will
        destroy the graph structure, to state the obvious).
\end{myitemize}

\section{Cylc Development History - Major Changes}

\begin{myitemize}

    \item {\bf pre-cylc-3} - early versions focused on the new
    scheduling algorithm. A suite was a collection of ``task definition
    files'' that encoded the prerequisites and outputs of each task,
    exposing cylc's self-organising nature. Tasks could be transferred
    from one suite to another by simply copying their taskdef files over
    and checking prerequisite and output consistency. Global suite
    structure was not easy to discern until run time (although cylc-2
    could generate resolved run time dependency graphs).

    \item {\bf cylc-3} - a new suite design interface: dependency graph
    and task runtime properties defined in a single structured,
    validated, configuration file - the suite.rc file; graphical user
    interface; suite graphing.

    \item {\bf cylc-4} - refined and organized the suite.rc file
    structure; task runtime properties defined by an efficient
    inheritance hierarchy; support for the Jinja2 template processor in
    suite definitions.

    \item {\bf cylc-5} - multi-threading for continuous network request
    handling and job submission; more task states to distinguish job
    submission from execution; dependence between suites via new suite
    run databases; polling and killing of real task jobs; polling as
    task communications option.

\end{myitemize}

\section{Pyro}
\label{Pyro}

Pyro (Python Remote Objects) is a widely used open source objected
oriented Remote Procedure Call technology developed by Irmen de Jong.

Earlier versions of cylc used the Pyro Nameserver to marshal
communication between client programs (tasks, commands, viewers, etc.)
and their target suites. This worked well, but in principle it
provided a route for one suite or user on the subnet to bring down
all running suites by killing the nameserver. Consequently cylc now
uses Pyro simply as a lightweight object oriented wrapper for
direct network socket communication between client programs and their
target suites - all suites are thus entirely isolated from one another.

%\subsection{Understanding Suite Evolution}
%\label{UnderstandingSuiteEvolution}
%
%On a cold-start all tasks (including one-off tasks) in the system will be
%instantiated at the initial cycle time, or at the next subsequent valid
%cycle time for the task. Any tasks that have no prerequisites (and, if
%they are contact tasks, have reached their trigger time) will submit to
%run immediately. Any cycling (i.e.\ non one-off) tasks that have no
%prerequisites (and, if they are contact tasks, have reached their
%trigger time) will rapidly spawn ahead until stopped by the suite's
%runahead limit (observe task X in the User Guide example suite).
%Thereafter, each task will, of its own accord, submit to run as soon as
%its prerequisites have been satisfied by other tasks already running or
%succeeded in the suite (and trigger time etc.).  Each task spawns a
%successor at a point in its life-cycle that depends on its type: tied
%tasks spawn has soon as their restart prerequisites have been completed,
%and free tasks spawn at the instant they start running.  Once a task
%exists it is free to run as soon as its prerequisites are satisfied,
%thus successive instances of a free task can run entirely in parallel,
%and successive instances of a tied task can overlap if the opportunity
%arises (other prerequisites allowing).

%\subsection{Automatic State Dumps}
%\label{AutomaticStateDumps}
%
%Cylc updates its configured state dump file (e.g.\
%\lstinline=$HOME/cylc-state/state=) every time the state of a task
%changes. Previous states are maintained in a rolling archive
%(length specified in the {\em suite.rc} file):
%
%\begin{lstlisting}
%nwp_oper> ls .cylc/state/SUITE/
%state       # current state
%state-1     # most recent previous state
%state-2     # next most recent previous state
%...
%state-N     # oldest state dump; will be deleted at next update
%\end{lstlisting}
%
%In addition, immediately prior to any system intervention a special
%uniquely named state dump file is created and logged, e.g.:
%
%\begin{lstlisting}
%2010/03/30 14:54:29 WARNING main - pre-purge state dump: state.2010:3:30:14:54:29
%\end{lstlisting}
%
%If you accidentally intervene wrongly in a suite, just shut it down
%and restart from the pre-intervention state dump:
%
%\begin{lstlisting}
%cylc restart SUITE state.2010:3:30:14:54:29
%\end{lstlisting}

%\subsection{Suite Log Files}
%\label{SuiteLogFiles}
%
%Earlier versions of cylc created a main suite log file and a
%task-specific log for every task. However, because when all logged
%events were made to percolate up to the main log the task-specific logs
%became superfluous. Instead, cylc provides facilities for filtering the
%main log for task-specific messages (or you can just use
%\lstinline=grep= for this purpose).
%
%\begin{lstlisting}
%$ tail $HOME/cylc-logs/intro/log
%2010/03/28 00:33:50 INFO main.F - [2010010312] disconnected (spent; general)
%2010/03/28 00:33:52 INFO main.C - [2010010400] storm surge fields ready for 2010010400

%2010/03/28 00:33:53 CRITICAL main - ALL RUNNING TASKS SUCCEEDED
%\end{lstlisting}
%
%Each entry shows the time of logging, the name and cycle time of the
%reporting task (in square brackets), and the logged message.
%
%In simulation mode, the logged time is the simulation mode accelerated clock time, not
%real time.
%
%Existing log files are automatically rotated at start-up and,
%individually, when they reach a size of 10 MB.  This maximum file
%size should be configurable, but it is currently hardwired in
%\lstinline=$CYLC_DIR/src/pimp_my_logger.py=.

%\subsection{Diagnosing A Stalled Suite}
%\label{DiagnosingAStalledSuite}
%
%In certain situations a suite may appear to be ``stuck'', i.e.\ no
%tasks are running and nothing appears to be happening. There are several
%possible reasons for this (it does not necessarily indicate a problem!):
%
%\begin{myitemize}
%    \item In {\em normal real time operation}, when all running tasks
%        have finished for the most recent cycle, nothing will happen
%        until the one or more contact tasks in the suite trigger at the
%        start of the next cycle. \lstinline=cylc show= tells if a
%        contact task has yet to reach its trigger time.
%
%    \item if every task in the suite has one or more unsatisfied
%        prerequisites, the suite will be stalled. This could happen,
%        for example, if you start a suite that contains tied (forecast
%        model) tasks without the corresponding one-off cold-start tasks to
%        satisfy their initial restart prerequisites.
%
%\end{myitemize}
%
%Operational suites should have automated means of alerting the
%operators to any failure that occurs
%
%\begin{myitemize}
%    \item If the system operator, perhaps in a post-task-failure
%    intervention, kills some tasks that are required to satisfy the
%    prerequisites of other tasks that still exist in the system, then
%    the suite will eventually stall as a result of these tasks being
%    unable to run. Solution: insert tasks (possibly one-off cold-start
%    tasks) to get the suite running again.
%
%    \ldots This could also happen if you purge enough
%    cycles that the difference between the pre- and post-purge tasks
%    is greater than the runahead limit. Solution: ensure your runahead
%    limit is large enough to span these gaps.
%
%    \item If a failed task has not yet been removed or reset by the
%    system operator it will eventually stall the suite. Solution:
%    Fix, or otherwise deal with, failed tasks as quickly as possible.
%
%    \item If through a suite design error error, a task exists that
%        cannot get its prerequisites satisfied by any other task in the
%        suite, that task will never run and will eventually cause the
%        suite to stall.  Solution: test the suite in simulation mode to
%        check that all prerequisites and outputs, suite-wide, are
%        compatible.
%
%    \item If a misconfigured external task does not report an output
%        that it is supposed to (i.e.\ as registered in its task proxy
%        definition file), then its task proxy will not record that
%        output as complete and cylc will set it to the 'failed' state
%        when it finishes without completing a registered output. A
%        failed task will eventually stall the suite, as explained above,
%        if it is not fixed and re-run, or removed from the suite.
%        Solution: ensure all external tasks report their outputs
%        correctly.

%\subsection{Failure Recovery Scenarios}
%\label{FailureRecoveryScenarios}
%
%\begin{myitemize}
%    \item {\em One forecast cycle runs into the next, after a delay in
%        operations}. This is never a problem for cylc; every task runs
%        as soon as it can run, regardless of forecast cycle, and any
%        task that can't run before its predecessor has finished will
%        wait.
%
%    \item {\em A delayed parallel trial or case study catches up to real
%        time operation}. This is no problem for cylc; any cylc suite
%        will seamlessly transition in and out of ``normal real time
%        operation'' (distinct cycles triggered by the wall clock) as needed.
%
%    \item {\em An external task fails, but can be fixed}. For example, a
%        forecast model aborts trying to read a corrupted data file that
%        can be regenerated correctly. The failed task will be noted by
%        cylc, and its downstream dependants will not be able to run,
%        but other tasks will carry on as normal while you address the
%        problem. When fixed, use `cylc reset' to get the failed task to
%        run again, after which it and its downstream dependants will
%        catch up to the rest of the suite as quickly as possible.
%
%    \item {\em An important external task fails, but cannot be fixed.}
%        In this case, if the task has a lot of downstream dependants,
%        you will presumably need omit one or more cycles of the affected
%        tasks, and cold-start their part of the suite at the earliest
%        possible subsequent cycle.  To do this, insert the relevant cold
%        start task, or task group, at the later cycle, then purge the
%        failed task and everything that depends on it (and on them, and
%        so on) down to the cold-start time.  Other downstream forecast
%        models will be able to pick up immediately so long their most
%        recent previous instance (i.e.\ just before the gap) wrote out
%        sufficient restart outputs to bridge the gap (otherwise they,
%        or perhaps the entire suite, will need to be cold-started).
%
%    \item {\em HELP, I attempted a drastic intervention in a complex
%        suite, using the horrifying purge command, and this time I
%        really screwed the pooch!} Before any operation that alters the
%        system state, cylc automatically writes out a special state dump
%        file and reports the filename in the main log. Shut the suite
%        down and restart it from its pre-intervention state (just
%        cut-and-paste the state dump filename from the main log file -
%        the file path is not required because the file will be in the
%        configured suite state dump directory).  Then {\em retry your
%        intervention in practice mode} before doing it for real!

%\subsection{Dead Suite Cleanup}
%%\label{Deadcleanup}
%
%\subsubsection{Normal Shutdown}
%
%Cylc waits for any currently running tasks to finish before shutting
%down cleanly. There will be nothing to clean up.
%
%\subsubsection{Shutdown NOW or Controlled Abort}
%
%If a critical error of some kind, or use of \lstinline=cylc stop --now=,
%results in an immediate suite shutdown while there are still external
%tasks running, any subsequent cylc messaging calls made by the
%still-running tasks will fail because the parent suite no longer
%exists. Depending on the exact circumstances this may result in some
%orphaned processes that need to be killed manually.
%
%\subsubsection{Uncontrolled Suite Abort}
%
%(To Do, check: currently no ill effects - maybe sockets (ports) remain
%tied up until they time out?).
