.. _PipeInJobScripts:

Use of pipes in job scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In bash, the return status of a pipeline is normally the exit status of the
last command. This is unsafe, because if any command in the pipeline fails, the
script will continue nevertheless.

For safety, a cylc task job script running in bash will have the
``set -o pipefail`` option turned on automatically. If a pipeline
exists in a task's ``script``, etc section, the failure of any part of
a pipeline will cause the command to return a non-zero code at the end, which
will be reported as a task job failure. Due to the unique nature of a pipeline,
the job file will trap the failure of the individual commands, as well as the
whole pipeline, and will attempt to report a failure back to the suite twice.
The second message is ignored by the suite, and so the behaviour can be safely
ignored. (You should probably still investigate the failure, however!)
