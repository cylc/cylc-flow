<span id="schedulingforecastsuites"></span><h3>1.1. Scheduling Forecast Suites<a class="headerlink" href="#scheduling-forecast-suites" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Environmental forecasting suites generate forecast products from a
potentially large group of interdependent scientific models and
associated data processing tasks. They are constrained by availability
of external driving data: typically one or more tasks will wait on real
time observations and/or model data from an external system, and these
will drive other downstream tasks, and so on. The dependency diagram for
a single forecast cycle point in such a system is a <em>Directed Acyclic Graph</em>
as shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-dep-one"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 1</span></a> (in our terminology, a
<em>forecast cycle point</em> is comprised of all tasks with a common <em>cycle point</em>,
which is the nominal analysis time or start time of the forecast
models in the group). In real time operation processing will consist of
a series of distinct forecast cycle points that are each initiated, after a
gap, by arrival of the new cycle point’s external driving data.</p>
<p>From a job scheduling perspective task execution order in such a system
must be carefully controlled in order to avoid dependency violations.
Ideally, each task should be queued for execution at the instant its
last prerequisite is satisfied; this is the best that can be done even
if queued tasks are not able to execute immediately because of resource
contention.</p>

<span id="id1"></span><h3>1.2. EcoConnect<a class="headerlink" href="#ecoconnect" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Cylc was developed for the EcoConnect Forecasting System at NIWA
(National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, New Zealand).
EcoConnect takes real time atmospheric and stream flow observations, and
operational global weather forecasts from the Met Office (UK), and uses
these to drive global sea state and regional data assimilating weather
models, which in turn drive regional sea state, storm surge, and
catchment river models, plus tide prediction, and a large number of
associated data collection, quality control, preprocessing,
post-processing, product generation, and archiving tasks <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id2">[1]</a>.
The global sea state forecast runs once daily. The regional
weather forecast runs four times daily but
it supplies surface winds and pressure to several downstream models that
run only twice daily, and precipitation accumulations to catchment river
models that run on an hourly cycle assimilating real time stream flow
observations and using the most recently available regional weather
forecast. EcoConnect runs on heterogeneous distributed hardware,
including a massively parallel supercomputer and several Linux servers.</p>

must manage, within a single forecast cycle point, multiple parallel
streams of execution that branch when one task generates output for
several downstream tasks, and merge when one task takes input from several
upstream tasks.</p>

</div>
<p>Now the question arises, what happens if the external driving data for
upcoming cycle points is available in advance, as it would be after a
significant delay in operations, or when running a historical case
study?  While the forecast model <em>a</em> appears to depend only on the
external data <em>x</em> at this stage of the discussion, in fact it would
typically also depend on its own previous instance for the model
<em>background state</em> used in initializing the new forecast. Thus, as
alluded to in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-dep-two-linked"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 3</span></a>, task <em>a</em> could in principle
start as soon as its predecessor has finished. <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-overlap"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 4</span></a>
shows, however, that starting a whole new cycle point at this point is
dangerous - it results in dependency violations in half of the tasks in
the example suite. In fact the situation could be even worse than this
- imagine that task <em>b</em> in the first cycle point is delayed for some
reason <em>after</em> the second cycle point has been launched. Clearly we must
consider handling inter-cycle dependence explicitly or else agree not to
start the next cycle point early, as is illustrated in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-job-no-overlap"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 5</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="inter-cycle-dependence">
<span id="intercyclepointdependence"></span><h4>1.3.2. Inter-Cycle Dependence<a class="headerlink" href="#inter-cycle-dependence" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Forecast models typically depend on their own most recent previous
forecast for background state or restart files of some kind (this is
called <em>warm cycling</em>) but there can also be inter-cycle dependence
between different tasks. In an atmospheric forecast analysis suite, for
instance, the weather model may generate background states for observation
processing and data-assimilation tasks in the next cycle point as well as for
the next forecast model run. In real time operation inter-cycle
dependence can be ignored because it is automatically satisfied when one cycle
point finishes before the next begins. If it is not ignored it drastically
complicates the dependency graph by blurring the clean boundary between
cycle points. <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-dep-multi"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 6</span></a> illustrates the problem for our
simple example suite assuming minimal inter-cycle dependence: the warm
cycled models (<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em>) each depend on their own previous instances.</p>
<p>For this reason, and because we tend to see forecasting suites in terms of
their real time characteristics, other metaschedulers have ignored
inter-cycle dependence and are thus restricted to running entire cycle
points in sequence at all times. This does not affect normal real time
operation but it can be a serious impediment when advance availability of
external driving data makes it possible, in principle, to run some tasks from
upcoming cycle points before the current cycle point is finished - as was
suggested at the end of the previous section. This can occur, for instance,
after operational delays (late arrival of external data, system maintenance,
etc.) and to an even greater extent in historical case studies and parallel
test suites started behind a real time operation. It can be a serious problem
for suites that have little downtime between forecast cycle points and
therefore take many cycle points to catch up after a delay. Without taking
account of inter-cycle dependence, the best that can be done, in
general, is to reduce the gap between cycle points to zero as shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#fig-job-no-overlap"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 5</span></a>. A limited crude overlap of the single
cycle point job schedule may be possible for specific task sets but the
allowable overlap may change if new tasks are added, and it is still dangerous:
it amounts to running different parts of a dependent system as if they were not
dependent and as such it cannot be guaranteed that some unforeseen delay in
one cycle point, after the next cycle point has begun, (e.g. due to resource
contention or task failures) won’t result in dependency violations.</p>

obtained by respecting all inter-cycle dependence. This assumes no delays due
to resource contention or otherwise - i.e. every task runs
as soon as it is ready to run. The scheduler running
this suite must be able to adapt dynamically to external conditions
that impact on multi-cycle-point scheduling in the presence of
inter-cycle dependence or else, again, risk bringing the system down
with dependency violations.</p>

is the best that can be done, in general, when inter-cycle
dependence is ignored.</span></p>
</div>
<p>To further illustrate the potential benefits of proper inter-cycle
dependency handling, <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-time-three"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 8</span></a> shows an operational
delay of almost one whole cycle point in a suite with little downtime between
cycle points. Above the time axis is the optimal schedule that is possible in
principle when inter-cycle dependence is taken into account, and below
it is the only safe schedule possible <em>in general</em> when it is ignored.
In the former case, even the cycle point immediately after the delay is hardly
affected, and subsequent cycle points are all on time, whilst in the latter
case it takes five full cycle points to catch up to normal real time
operation <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id7" id="id3">[2]</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-time-two"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 9</span></a> shows example suite job schedules
for an historical case study, or when catching up after a very long
delay; i.e. when the external driving data are available many cycle
points in advance. Task <em>a</em>, which as the most upstream forecast
model is likely to be a resource intensive atmosphere or ocean model,
has no upstream dependence on co-temporal tasks and can therefore run
continuously, regardless of how much downstream processing is yet to be
completed in its own, or any previous, forecast cycle point (actually,
task <em>a</em> does depend on co-temporal task <em>x</em> which waits on the
external driving data, but that returns immediately when the data is
available in advance, so the result stands). The other forecast models
can also cycle continuously or with a short gap between, and some
post processing tasks, which have no previous-instance dependence, can
run continuously or even overlap (e.g. <em>e</em> in this case). Thus,
even for this very simple example suite, tasks from three or four
different cycle points can in principle run simultaneously at any given time.</p>
<p>In fact, if our tasks are able to trigger off internal outputs of
upstream tasks (message triggers) rather than waiting on full completion,
then successive instances of the forecast models could overlap as well
(because model restart outputs are generally completed early in the forecast)
for an even more efficient job schedule <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id8" id="id4">[3]</a>.</p>

and circles represent different prerequisites and outputs. A task

</div>
<p>Cylc manages a pool of proxy objects that represent the real tasks in a
suite. Task proxies know how to run the real tasks that they represent,
and they receive progress messages from the tasks as they run (usually
reports of completed outputs). There is no global cycling mechanism to
advance the suite; instead individual task proxies have their own
private cycle point and spawn their own successors when the time is
right. Task proxies are self-contained - they know their own
prerequisites and outputs but are not aware of the wider suite.
Inter-cycle dependence is not treated as special, and the task pool can
be populated with tasks with many different cycle points. The task pool
is illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-task-pool"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 10</span></a>. <em>Whenever any task
changes state due to completion of an output, every task checks to see
if its own prerequisites have been satisfied</em> <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id9" id="id5">[4]</a>.
In effect, cylc gets a pool of tasks to self-organize by negotiating
their own dependencies so that optimal scheduling, as described in the
previous section, emerges naturally at run time.</p>

<p>Cylc releases can be downloaded from <a class="reference external" href="https://cylc.github.io/cylc">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>The wrapper script <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">usr/bin/cylc</span></code> should be installed to
the system executable search path (e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/usr/local/bin/</span></code>) and
modified slightly to point to a location such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/opt</span></code> where
successive Cylc releases will be unpacked side by side.</p>
<p>To install Cylc, unpack the release tarball in the right location, e.g.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/opt/cylc-7.7.0</span></code>, type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make</span></code> inside the release
directory, and set site defaults - if necessary - in a site global config file
(below).</p>
<p>Make a symbolic link from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span></code> to the latest installed version:
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ln</span> <span class="pre">-s</span> <span class="pre">/opt/cylc-7.7.0</span> <span class="pre">/opt/cylc</span></code>. This will be invoked by the
central wrapper if a specific version is not requested. Otherwise, the
wrapper will attempt to invoke the Cylc version specified in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$CYLC_VERSION</span></code>, e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CYLC_VERSION=7.7.0</span></code>. This variable
is automatically set in task job scripts to ensure that jobs use the same Cylc
version as their parent suite server program.  It can also be set by users,
manually or in login scripts, to fix the Cylc version in their environment.</p>
<p>Installing subsequent releases is just a matter of unpacking the new tarballs
next to the previous releases, running <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">make</span></code> in them, and copying
in (possibly with modifications) the previous site global config file.</p>

<span id="localinstall"></span><h4>3.3.1. Local User Installation<a class="headerlink" href="#local-user-installation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>It is easy to install Cylc under your own user account if you don’t have
root or sudo access to the system: just put the central Cylc wrapper in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$HOME/bin/</span></code> (making sure that is in your <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$PATH</span></code>) and
modify it to point to a directory such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$HOME/cylc/</span></code> where you
will unpack and install release tarballs. Local installation of third party
dependencies like Graphviz is also possible, but that depends on the particular
installation methods used and is outside of the scope of this document.</p>

<p>If your users submit task jobs to hosts other than the hosts they use to run
their suites, you should ensure that the job hosts have the correct environment
for running cylc. A cylc suite generates task job scripts that normally invoke
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bash</span> <span class="pre">-l</span></code>, i.e. it will invoke bash as a login shell to run the job
script. Users and sites should ensure that their bash login profiles are able
to set up the correct environment for running cylc and their task jobs.</p>
<p>Your site administrator may customise the environment for all task jobs by
adding a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;cylc-dir&gt;/etc/job-init-env.sh</span></code> file and populate it with the
appropriate contents. If customisation is still required, you can add your own
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">${HOME}/.cylc/job-init-env.sh</span></code> file and populate it with the
appropriate contents.</p>

<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;cylc-dir&gt;/etc/job-init-env.sh</span></code></li>

environment.</p>

<h3>4.1. Jobs and Tasks<a class="headerlink" href="#jobs-and-tasks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A <em>job</em> is a program or script that runs on a computer, and a <em>task</em> is

<div class="section" id="cycle-points">
<h3>4.2. Cycle Points<a class="headerlink" href="#cycle-points" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A <em>cycle point</em> is a particular date-time (or integer) point in a sequence
of date-time (or integer) points. Each cylc task has a private cycle point and
can advance independently to subsequent cycle points. It may sometimes be
convenient, however, to refer to the “current cycle point” of a suite (or the
previous or next one, etc.) with reference to a particular task, or in the
sense of all tasks instances that “belong to” a particular cycle point. But
keep in mind that different tasks may pass through the “current cycle point”
(etc.) at different times as the suite evolves.</p>

<span id="id1"></span><h2>5. Workflows For Cycling Systems<a class="headerlink" href="#workflows-for-cycling-systems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A model run and associated processing may need to be cycled for the following
reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>In real time forecasting systems, a new forecast may be initiated
at regular intervals when new real time data comes in.</li>
<li>It may be convenient (or necessary, e.g. due to batch scheduler
queue limits) to split single long model runs into many smaller chunks,
each with associated pre- and post-processing workflows.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cylc provides two ways of constructing workflows for cycling systems:
<em>cycling workflows</em> and <em>parameterized tasks</em>.</p>
<div class="section" id="cycling-workflows">
<span id="id2"></span><h3>5.1. Cycling Workflows<a class="headerlink" href="#cycling-workflows" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This is cylc’s classic cycling mode as described in the Introduction. Each
instance of a cycling job is represented by a new instance of <em>the same task</em>,
with a new cycle point. The suite configuration defines patterns for
extending the workflow on the fly, so it can keep running indefinitely if
necessary. For example, to cycle <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">model.exe</span></code> on a monthly sequence we
could define a single task <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">model</span></code>, an initial cycle point, and a
monthly sequence. Cylc then generates the date-time sequence and creates a new
task instance for each cycle point as it comes up. Workflow dependencies are
defined generically with respect to the “current cycle point” of the tasks
involved.</p>
<p>This is the only sensible way to run very large suites or operational suites
that need to continue cycling indefinitely. The cycling is configured with
standards-based ISO 8601 date-time <em>recurrence expressions</em>. Multiple
cycling sequences can be used at once in the same suite. See
<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#configuringscheduling"><span class="std std-ref">Scheduling - Dependency Graphs</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="parameterized-tasks-as-a-proxy-for-cycling">
<span id="id3"></span><h3>5.2. Parameterized Tasks as a Proxy for Cycling<a class="headerlink" href="#parameterized-tasks-as-a-proxy-for-cycling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is also possible to run cycling jobs with a pre-defined static workflow in
which each instance of a cycling job is represented by <em>a different task</em>:
as far as the abstract workflow is concerned there is no cycling. The sequence
of tasks can be constructed efficiently, however, using cylc’s built-in suite
parameters (<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#parameterized-cycling"><span class="std std-ref">Parameterized Cycling</span></a>) or explicit Jinja2 loops
(<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#jinja"><span class="std std-ref">Jinja2</span></a>).</p>
<p>For example, to run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">model.exe</span></code> 12 times on a monthly cycle we could
loop over an integer parameter <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">R</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">0,</span> <span class="pre">1,</span> <span class="pre">2,</span> <span class="pre">...,</span> <span class="pre">11</span></code> to define tasks
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">model-R0,</span> <span class="pre">model-R1,</span> <span class="pre">model-R2,</span> <span class="pre">...model-R11</span></code>, and the parameter
values could be multiplied by the interval <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">P1M</span></code> (one month) to get
the start point for the corresponding model run.</p>
<p>This method is only good for smaller workflows of finite duration because every
single task has to be mapped out in advance, and cylc has to be aware of all of
them throughout the entire run. Additionally Cylc’s <em>cycling workflow</em>
capabilities (above) are more powerful, more flexible, and generally easier to
use (Cylc will generate the cycle point date-times for you, for instance), so
that is the recommended way to drive most cycling systems.</p>
<p>The primary use for parameterized tasks in cylc is to generate ensembles and
other groups of related tasks at the same cycle point, not as a proxy for
cycling.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mixed-cycling-workflows">
<h3>5.3. Mixed Cycling Workflows<a class="headerlink" href="#mixed-cycling-workflows" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For completeness we note that parameterized cycling can be used within a
cycling workflow. For example, in a daily cycling workflow long (daily)
model runs could be split into four shorter runs by parameterized cycling.
A simpler six-hourly cycling workflow should be considered first, however.</p>

<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# How to create a site or user global.rc config file.
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The &quot;cylc get-global-config&quot; command prints - in valid global.rc format -
# system global defaults, overridden by site global settings (if any),
# overridden by user global settings (if any).
#
# Therefore, to generate a new global config file, do this:
#   % cylc get-global-config &gt; global.rc
# edit it as needed and install it in the right location (below).
#
# For legal config items, see the User Guide&#39;s global.rc reference appendix.
#
# FILE LOCATIONS:
#----------------------
# SITE: delete or comment out items that you do not need to change (otherwise
# you may unwittingly override future changes to system defaults).
#
# The SITE FILE LOCATION is [cylc-dir]/etc/global.rc, where [cylc-dir] is your
# install location, e.g. /opt/cylc/cylc-7.7.0.
#
# FORWARD COMPATIBILITY: The site global.rc file must be kept in the source
# installation (i.e. it is version specific) because older versions of Cylc
# will not understand newer global config items. WHEN YOU INSTALL A NEW VERSION
# OF CYLC, COPY OVER YOUR OLD SITE GLOBAL CONFIG FILE AND ADD TO IT IF NEEDED.
#
#----------------------
# USER: delete or comment out items that you do not need to change (otherwise
# you may unwittingly override future changes to site or system defaults).
#
# The USER FILE LOCATIONS are:
#   1) ~/.cylc/&lt;CYLC-VERSION&gt;/global.rc  # e.g. ~/.cylc/7.7.0/global.rc
#   2) ~/.cylc/global.rc
# If the first lcoation is not found, the second will be checked.
# 
# The version-specific location is preferred - see FORWARD COMPATIBILITY above.
# WHEN YOU FIRST USE A NEW VERSION OF CYLC, COPY OVER YOUR OLD USER GLOBAL
# CONFIG FILE AND TO IT IF NEEDED. However, if you only set a items that don&#39;t
# change from one version to the next, you may be OK with the second location.

<p><strong>suite</strong>: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tut/oneoff/basic</span></code></p>
<p>Here’s the traditional <em>Hello World</em> program rendered as a cylc
suite:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[meta]</span>
    <span class="nv">title </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> &quot;The cylc Hello World! suite&quot;</span>

        <span class="nv">script </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> &quot;sleep 10; echo Hello World!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Cylc suites feature a clean separation of scheduling configuration,
which determines <em>when</em> tasks are ready to run; and runtime
configuration, which determines <em>what</em> to run (and <em>where</em> and
<em>how</em> to run it) when a task is ready. In this example the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[scheduling]</span></code> section defines a single task called
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hello</span></code> that triggers immediately when the suite starts
up. When the task finishes the suite shuts down. That this is a
<em>dependency graph</em> will be more obvious when more tasks are added.
Under the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[runtime]</span></code> section the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">script</span></code> item defines a simple inlined
implementation for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hello</span></code>: it sleeps for ten seconds,
then prints <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Hello</span> <span class="pre">World!</span></code>, and exits. This ends up in a <em>job script</em>
generated by cylc to encapsulate the task (below) and,
thanks to some defaults designed to allow quick
prototyping of new suites, it is submitted to run as a background job on
the suite host. In fact cylc even provides a default task implementation
that makes the entire <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[runtime]</span></code> section technically optional:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[meta]</span>
    <span class="nv">title </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> &quot;The minimal complete runnable cylc suite&quot;</span>

<span class="c1"># (actually, &#39;title&#39; is optional too ... and so is this comment)</span>

information and exits).</p>

<div class="section" id="editing-suites">
<h3>7.10. Editing Suites<a class="headerlink" href="#editing-suites" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

by cylc site and user global config files, as shown above in <a class="reference internal" href="#cui"><span class="std std-ref">User Interfaces</span></a>.
Check that you have renamed the tutorial examples suites as described
just above and open the <em>Hello World</em> suite in your text editor:</p>

</div>
<p>and choose <em>Suite</em> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-&gt;</span></code> <em>Edit</em> from the menu.</p>
<p>The editor will be invoked from within the suite configuration directory
for easy access to other suite files (in this case there are none). There are

<p>The suite run database files, suite environment file,
and task status files are used internally by cylc. Tasks execute in
private <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">work/</span></code> directories that are deleted automatically
if empty when the task finishes. The suite
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">share/</span></code> directory is made available to all tasks (by
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$CYLC_SUITE_SHARE_DIR</span></code>) as a common share space. The task submission
number increments from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1</span></code> if a task retries; this is used as a
sub-directory of the log tree to avoid overwriting log files from earlier
job submissions.</p>
<p>The top level run directory location can be changed in site and user
config files if necessary, and the suite share and work locations can be
configured separately because of the potentially larger disk space
requirement.</p>
<p>Task job logs can be viewed by right-clicking on tasks in the gcylc
GUI (so long as the task proxy is live in the suite), manually
accessed from the log directory (of course), or printed to the terminal
with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">cat-log</span></code> command:</p>

<p>The Cylc Review web service displays suite job logs and other information in
web pages, as shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-review-screenshot"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 15</span></a>. It can run under a
WSGI server (e.g. Apache with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mod_wsgi</span></code>) as a service for all
users, or as an ad hoc service under your own user account.</p>
<p>If a central Cylc Review service has been set up at your site (e.g. as
described in <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#configuringcylcreviewapache"><span class="std std-ref">Configuring Cylc Review Under Apache</span></a>) the URL will typically be
something like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">http://&lt;server&gt;/cylc-review/</span></code>.</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In general, a <em>task remote</em> is a user account, other than the account
running the suite server program, where a task job is submitted to run. It can
be on the same machine running the suite or on another machine.</p>
<p>A task remote account must satisfy several requirements:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Non-interactive ssh must be enabled from the account running the suite
server program to the account for submitting (and managing) the remote
task job.</li>
<li>Network settings must allow communication <em>back</em> from the remote task
job to the suite, either by network ports or ssh, unless the last-resort one
way <em>task polling</em> communication method is used.</li>
<li>Cylc must be installed and runnable on the task remote account. Other
software dependencies like graphviz are not required there.</li>
<li>Any files needed by a remote task must be installed on the task
host. In this example there is nothing to install because the
implementation of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hello</span></code> is inlined in the suite configuration
and thus ends up entirely contained within the task job script.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your username is different on the task host, you can add a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">User</span></code>
setting for the relevant host in your <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">~/.ssh/config</span></code>.
If you are unable to do so, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[[[remote]]]</span></code> section also supports an
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">owner=username</span></code> item.</p>
<p>If you configure a task account according to the requirements cylc will invoke
itself on the remote account (with a login shell by default) to create log
directories, transfer any essential service files, send the task job script
over, and submit it to run there by the configured batch system.</p>
<p>Remote task job logs are saved to the suite run directory on the task remote,
not on the account running the suite. They can be retrieved by right-clicking
on the task in the GUI, or to have cylc pull them back to the suite account
automatically do this:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[runtime]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[hello]]</span>
        <span class="nv">script </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> &quot;sleep 10; echo Hello World!&quot;</span>
        <span class="nt">[[[remote]]]</span>
            <span class="nv">host </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> server1.niwa.co.nz</span>
            <span class="nv">retrieve job logs </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> True</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This suite will attempt to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rsync</span></code> job logs from the remote
host each time a task job completes.</p>
<p>Some batch systems have considerable delays between the time when the job
completes and when it writes the job logs in its normal location. If this is
the case, you can configure an initial delay and retry delays for job log
retrieval by setting some delays. E.g.:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[runtime]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[hello]]</span>
        <span class="nv">script </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> &quot;sleep 10; echo Hello World!&quot;</span>
        <span class="nt">[[[remote]]]</span>
            <span class="nv">host </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> server1.niwa.co.nz</span>
            <span class="nv">retrieve job logs </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> True</span>
            <span class="c1"># Retry after 10 seconds, 1 minute and 3 minutes</span>
            <span class="nv">retrieve job logs retry delays </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> PT10S, PT1M, PT3M</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Finally, if the disk space of the suite host is limited, you may want to set
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[[[remote]]]retrieve</span> <span class="pre">job</span> <span class="pre">logs</span> <span class="pre">max</span> <span class="pre">size=SIZE</span></code>. The value of SIZE can
be anything that is accepted by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--max-size=SIZE</span></code> option of the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rsync</span></code> command. E.g.:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[runtime]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[hello]]</span>
        <span class="nv">script </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> &quot;sleep 10; echo Hello World!&quot;</span>
        <span class="nt">[[[remote]]]</span>
            <span class="nv">host </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> server1.niwa.co.nz</span>
            <span class="nv">retrieve job logs </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> True</span>
            <span class="c1"># Don&#39;t get anything bigger than 10MB</span>
            <span class="nv">retrieve job logs max size </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> 10M</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It is worth noting that cylc uses the existence of a job’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">job.out</span></code>
or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">job.err</span></code> in the local file system to indicate a successful job
log retrieval. If <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">retrieve</span> <span class="pre">job</span> <span class="pre">logs</span> <span class="pre">max</span> <span class="pre">size=SIZE</span></code> is set and both
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">job.out</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">job.err</span></code> are bigger than <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SIZE</span></code>
then cylc will consider the retrieval as failed. If retry delays are specified,
this will trigger some useless (but harmless) retries. If this occurs
regularly, you should try the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Reduce the verbosity of STDOUT or STDERR from the task.</li>
<li>Redirect the verbosity from STDOUT or STDERR to an alternate log file.</li>
<li>Adjust the size limit with tolerance to the expected size of STDOUT or
STDERR.</li>

</div>
<p>i.e. if task <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">goodbye</span></code> fails, trigger another task that
(presumably) really says goodbye.</p>
<p>Failure triggering generally requires use of <em>suicide triggers</em> as

would hang about indefinitely in the waiting state):</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>

<p>This means if <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">goodbye</span></code> fails, trigger

<p>Try running <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tut/oneoff/suicide</span></code>, which also configures

<p>Task families defined by runtime inheritance can also be used as

<h3>7.22. Triggering Off Of Families<a class="headerlink" href="#triggering-off-of-families" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>suite</strong>: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tut/oneoff/ftrigger2</span></code></p>
<p>Tasks (or families) can also trigger <em>off</em> other families, but
in this case we need to specify what the trigger means in terms of
the upstream family members. Here’s how to trigger another task
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bar</span></code> if all members of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GREETERS</span></code> succeed:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[dependencies]]</span>
        <span class="nv">graph</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span><span class="kd">foo</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kd">GREETERS</span>
            <span class="kd">GREETERS</span><span class="c">:</span><span class="kd">succeed</span><span class="c">-</span><span class="kd">all</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kd">bar</span><span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Verbose validation in this case reports:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ cylc val -v tut/oneoff/ftrigger2
...
Graph line substitutions occurred:
  IN: GREETERS:succeed-all <span class="o">=</span>&gt; bar
  OUT: greeter_1:succeed <span class="p">&amp;</span> greeter_2:succeed <span class="o">=</span>&gt; bar
...
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Cylc ignores family member qualifiers like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">succeed-all</span></code> on
the right side of a trigger arrow, where they don’t make sense, to
allow the two graph lines above to be combined in simple cases:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[dependencies]]</span>
        <span class="nv">graph</span><span class="s"> </span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="c">&quot;</span><span class="kd">foo</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kd">GREETERS</span><span class="c">:</span><span class="kd">succeed</span><span class="c">-</span><span class="kd">all</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kd">bar</span><span class="c">&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Any task triggering status qualified by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-all</span></code> or
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-any</span></code>, for the members, can be used with a family trigger.
For example, here’s how to trigger <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bar</span></code> if all members
of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GREETERS</span></code> finish (succeed or fail) and any of them succeed:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[dependencies]]</span>
        <span class="nv">graph</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span><span class="kd">foo</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kd">GREETERS</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>(use of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GREETERS:succeed-any</span></code> by itself here would trigger
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bar</span></code> as soon as any one member of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">GREETERS</span></code>
completed successfully). Verbose validation now begins to show how
family triggers can simplify complex graphs, even for this tiny
two-member family:</p>

<p>The tasks in our examples so far have all had inlined implementation, in
the suite configuration, but real tasks often need to call external
commands, scripts, or executables. To try this, let’s return to the
basic Hello World suite and cut the implementation of the task
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hello</span></code> out to a file <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hello.sh</span></code> in the suite bin directory:</p>

<p>If you run the suite now the new greeting from the external task script

appropriately yourself (this could be done via

<p>So far we’ve considered non-cycling tasks, which finish without spawning
a successor.</p>
<p>Cycling is based around iterating through date-time or integer sequences. A
cycling task may run at each cycle point in a given sequence (cycle). For
example, a sequence might be a set of date-times every 6 hours starting from a
particular date-time. A cycling task may run for each date-time item (cycle
point) in that sequence.</p>
<p>There may be multiple instances of this type of task running in parallel, if
the opportunity arises and their dependencies allow it. Alternatively, a
sequence can be defined with only one valid cycle point - in that case, a task
belonging to that sequence may only run once.</p>

<p>The suite above is a very simple example of a cycling date-time workflow. More
generally, cylc comprehensively supports the ISO 8601 standard for date-time
instants, intervals, and sequences. Cycling graph sections can be specified
using full ISO 8601 recurrence expressions, but these may be simplified
by assuming context information from the suite - namely initial and final cycle
points. One form of the recurrence syntax looks like
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Rn/start-date-time/period</span></code> (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Rn</span></code> means run <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">n</span></code> times). In the example
above, if the initial cycle point
is always at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">00</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">12</span></code> hours then <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[[[T00,T12]]]</span></code> could be

<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[[[R/initial-cycle-point/PT12H/]]]</span></code> - i.e. run every 12 hours
indefinitely starting at the initial cycle point. It is possible to add
constraints to the suite to only allow initial cycle points at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">00</span></code> or
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">12</span></code> hours e.g.</p>

<p class="last">The first instance of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span></code>, at suite start-up, will
trigger immediately in spite of its inter-cycle trigger, because cylc
ignores dependence on points earlier than the initial cycle point.
However, the presence of an inter-cycle trigger usually implies something
special has to happen at start-up. If a model depends on its own previous
instance for restart files, for example, then some special process has to
generate the initial set of restart files when there is no previous cycle
point to do it. The following section shows one way to handle this
in cylc suites.</p>

<span id="id3"></span><h4>7.25.3. Initial Non-Repeating (R1) Tasks<a class="headerlink" href="#initial-non-repeating-r1-tasks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p><strong>suite</strong>: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tut/cycling/three</span></code></p>
<p>Sometimes we want to be able to run a task at the initial cycle point, but
refrain from running it in subsequent cycles. We can do this by writing an
extra set of dependencies that are only valid at a single date-time cycle
point. If we choose this to be the initial cycle point, these will only apply
at the very start of the suite.</p>
<p>The cylc syntax for writing this single date-time cycle point occurrence is
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">R1</span></code>, which stands for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">R1/no-specified-date-time/no-specified-period</span></code>.
This is an adaptation of part of the ISO 8601 date-time standard’s recurrence
syntax (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Rn/date-time/period</span></code>) with some special context information
supplied by cylc for the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">no-specified-*</span></code> data.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1</span></code> in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">R1</span></code> means run once. As we’ve specified
no date-time, Cylc will use the initial cycle point date-time by default,
which is what we want. We’ve also missed out specifying the period - this is
set by cylc to a zero amount of time in this case (as it never
repeats, this is not significant).</p>
<p>For example, in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">tut/cycling/three</span></code>:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[cylc]</span>

the local time zone of your machine will be used in the cycle points.</p>
</div>
<p>At the initial cycle point, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span></code> will depend on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo[-PT12H]</span></code> and also
on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">prep</span></code>:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">prep.20130808T0000+13 &amp; foo.20130807T1200+13 </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&gt; foo.20130808T0000+13</span>

</div>
<p>Thereafter, it will just look like e.g.:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">foo.20130808T0000+13 </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&gt; foo.20130808T1200+13</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>However, in our initial cycle point example, the dependence on
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo.20130807T1200+13</span></code> will be ignored, because that task’s cycle
point is earlier than the suite’s initial cycle point and so it cannot run.
This means that the initial cycle point dependencies for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span></code>
actually look like:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">prep.20130808T0000+13 </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&gt; foo.20130808T0000+13</span>

<p>The integer cycling notation is intended to look similar to the ISO 8601
date-time notation, but it is simpler for obvious reasons. The example suite
illustrates two recurrence forms,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Rn/start-point/period</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Rn/period/stop-point</span></code>, simplified somewhat using suite context
information (namely the initial and final cycle points). The first form is
used to run one special task called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">start</span></code> at start-up, and for the
main cycling body of the suite; and the second form to run another special task
called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">stop</span></code> in the final two cycles. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">P</span></code> character
denotes period (interval) just like in the date-time notation.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">R/1/P2</span></code> would generate the sequence of points <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1,3,5,...</span></code>.</p>

you can think of include-files as chunks of the suite.rc file simply
cut-and-pasted into another file. Include-files may be included
multiple times in the same file, and even nested. Include-file paths
can be specified portably relative to the suite configuration directory,
e.g.:</p>

<p>Cylc suite.rc files are automatically validated against a specification
that defines all legal entries, values, options, and defaults. This
detects formatting errors, typographic errors, illegal items and illegal
values prior to run time. Some values are complex strings that require
further parsing by cylc to determine their correctness (this is also
done during validation). All legal entries are documented in
(<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#suitercreference"><span class="std std-ref">Suite.rc Reference</span></a>).</p>
<p>The validator reports the line numbers of detected errors. Here’s an
example showing a section heading with a missing right bracket:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ cylc validate my.suite
    <span class="o">[[</span>special tasks<span class="o">]</span>

<p>If the suite.rc file uses include-files <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">view</span></code> will
show an inlined copy of the suite with correct line numbers
(you can also edit suites in a temporarily inlined state with
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">edit</span> <span class="pre">--inline</span></code>).</p>

<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[scheduling]</span></code> section of a suite.rc file defines the
relationships between tasks in a suite - the information that allows
cylc to determine when tasks are ready to run. The most important

<h4>9.3.2. Interpreting Graph Strings<a class="headerlink" href="#interpreting-graph-strings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Suite dependency graphs can be broken down into pairs in which the left
side (which may be a single task or family, or several that are
conditionally related) defines a trigger for the task or family on the
right. For instance the “word graph” <em>C triggers off B which
triggers off A</em> can be deconstructed into pairs <em>C triggers off B</em>
and <em>B triggers off A</em>. In this section we use only the default
trigger type, which is to trigger off the upstream task succeeding;
see <a class="reference internal" href="#triggertypes"><span class="std std-ref">Task Triggering</span></a> for other available triggers.</p>
<p>In the case of cycling tasks, the triggers defined by a graph string are
valid for cycle points matching the list of hours specified for the
graph section. For example this graph:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[dependencies]]</span>
        <span class="nt">[[[T00,T12]]]</span>
            <span class="nv">graph</span><span class="s"> </span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="c">&quot;</span><span class="kd">A</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kd">B</span><span class="c">&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>implies that B triggers off A for cycle points in which the hour matches <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">00</span></code>
or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">12</span></code>.</p>
<p>To define inter-cycle dependencies, attach an offset indicator to the
left side of a pair:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[dependencies]]</span>
        <span class="nt">[[[T00,T12]]]</span>
            <span class="nv">graph</span><span class="s"> </span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="c">&quot;</span><span class="kd">A</span>[<span class="nb">-PT12H</span>] <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kd">B</span><span class="c">&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This means B[time] triggers off A[time-PT12H] (12 hours before) for cycle
points with hours matching <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">00</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">12</span></code>. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">time</span></code> is implicit because
this keeps graphs clean and concise, given that the
majority of tasks will typically
depend only on others with the same cycle point. Cycle point offsets can only
appear on the left of a pair, because a pairs define triggers for the right
task at cycle point <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">time</span></code>. However, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A</span> <span class="pre">=&gt;</span> <span class="pre">B[-PT6H]</span></code>, which is
illegal, can be reformulated as a <em>future trigger</em>
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">A[+PT6H]</span> <span class="pre">=&gt;</span> <span class="pre">B</span></code> (see <a class="reference internal" href="#intercyclepointtriggers"><span class="std std-ref">Inter-Cycle Triggers</span></a>). It is also
possible to combine multiple offsets within a cycle point offset e.g.</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[dependencies]]</span>
        <span class="nt">[[[T00,T12]]]</span>
            <span class="nv">graph</span><span class="s"> </span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="c">&quot;</span><span class="kd">A</span>[<span class="nb">-P1D-PT12H</span>] <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kd">B</span><span class="c">&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This means that B[Time] triggers off A[time-P1D-PT12H] (1 day and 12 hours
before).</p>
<p>Triggers can be chained together. This graph:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">graph</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span><span class="kd">A</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kd">B</span>  <span class="c1"># B triggers off A</span>
           <span class="kd">B</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kd">C</span>  <span class="c1"># C triggers off B&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>is equivalent to this:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">graph</span><span class="s"> </span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="c">&quot;</span><span class="kd">A</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kd">B</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kd">C</span><span class="c">&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p><em>Each trigger in the graph must be unique</em> but <em>the same task

<h4>9.3.4. Graph Section Headings<a class="headerlink" href="#graph-section-headings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Graph section headings define recurrence expressions, the graph within a graph
section heading defines a workflow at each point of the recurrence. For
example in the following scenario:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">T06</span></code> means “Run every day starting at 06:00 after the
initial cycle point”. Cylc allows you to start (or end) at any particular
time, repeat at whatever frequency you like, and even optionally limit the
number of repetitions.</p>
<p>Graph section heading can also be used with integer cycling see
<a class="reference internal" href="#integercycling"><span class="std std-ref">Integer Cycling</span></a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="syntax-rules">
<h5>9.3.4.1. Syntax Rules<a class="headerlink" href="#syntax-rules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Date-time cycling information is made up of a starting <em>date-time</em>, an
<em>interval</em>, and an optional <em>limit</em>.</p>
<p>The time is assumed to be in the local time zone unless you set
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[cylc]cycle</span> <span class="pre">point</span> <span class="pre">time</span> <span class="pre">zone</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[cylc]UTC</span> <span class="pre">mode</span></code>. The
calendar is assumed to be the proleptic Gregorian calendar unless you set
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[scheduling]cycling</span> <span class="pre">mode</span></code>.</p>
<p>The syntax for representations is based on the ISO 8601 date-time standard.
This includes the representation of <em>date-time</em>, <em>interval</em>. What we
define for cylc’s cycling syntax is our own optionally-heavily-condensed form
of ISO 8601 recurrence syntax. The most common full form is:
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">R[limit?]/[date-time]/[interval]</span></code>. However, we allow omitting
information that can be guessed from the context (rules below). This means
that it can be written as:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>R[limit?]/[date-time]
R[limit?]//[interval]
[date-time]/[interval]
R[limit?] # Special limit of 1 case
[date-time]
[interval]
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>with example graph headings for each form being:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[[[ R5/T00 ]]]</span>           <span class="c1"># Run 5 times at 00:00 every day</span>
<span class="nt">[[[ R//PT1H ]]]</span>          <span class="c1"># Run every hour (Note the R// is redundant)</span>
<span class="nt">[[[ 20000101T00Z/P1D ]]]</span> <span class="c1"># Run every day starting at 00:00 1st Jan 2000</span>
<span class="nt">[[[ R1 ]]]</span>               <span class="c1"># Run once at the initial cycle point</span>

<div class="admonition note">

<p class="last"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">T00</span></code> is an example of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[date-time]</span></code>, with an
inferred 1 day period and no limit.</p>
</div>
<p>Where some or all <em>date-time</em> information is omitted, it is inferred to
be relative to the initial date-time cycle point. For example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">T00</span></code>
by itself would mean the next occurrence of midnight that follows, or is, the
initial cycle point. Entering <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">+PT6H</span></code> would mean 6 hours after the
initial cycle point. Entering <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-P1D</span></code> would mean 1 day before the
initial cycle point. Entering no information for the <em>date-time</em> implies
the initial cycle point date-time itself.</p>
<p>Where the <em>interval</em> is omitted and some (but not all) <em>date-time</em>
information is omitted, it is inferred to be a single unit above
the largest given specific <em>date-time</em> unit. For example, the largest
given specific unit in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">T00</span></code> is hours, so the inferred interval is
1 day (daily), <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">P1D</span></code>.</p>
<p>Where the <em>limit</em> is omitted, unlimited cycling is assumed. This will be
bounded by the final cycle point’s date-time if given.</p>
<p>Another supported form of ISO 8601 recurrence is:
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">R[limit?]/[interval]/[date-time]</span></code>. This form uses the
<em>date-time</em> as the end of the cycling sequence rather than the start.
For example, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">R3/P5D/20140430T06</span></code> means:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>20140420T06
20140425T06
20140430T06
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This kind of form can be used for specifying special behaviour near the end of
the suite, at the final cycle point’s date-time. We can also represent this in
cylc with a collapsed form:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>R[limit?]/[interval]
R[limit?]//[date-time]
[interval]/[date-time]
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>So, for example, you can write:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[[[ R1//+P0D ]]]</span>  <span class="c1"># Run once at the final cycle point</span>
<span class="nt">[[[ R5/P1D ]]]</span>    <span class="c1"># Run 5 times, every 1 day, ending at the final</span>
                  <span class="c1"># cycle point</span>
<span class="nt">[[[ P2W/T00 ]]]</span>   <span class="c1"># Run every 2 weeks ending at 00:00 following</span>
                  <span class="c1"># the final cycle point</span>
<span class="nt">[[[ R//T00 ]]]</span>    <span class="c1"># Run every 1 day ending at 00:00 following the</span>

<p>In addition to excluding isolated date-time points or lists of date-time points
from recurrences, exclusions themselves may be date-time recurrence sequences.
Any partial date-time or sequence given after the exclamation mark will be
excluded from the main sequence.</p>
<p>For example, partial date-times can be excluded using the syntax:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[[[ PT1H ! T12 ]]]</span>          <span class="c1"># Run hourly but not at 12:00 from the initial</span>

                                      <span class="c1"># 12:00, 18:00.</span>

<span class="nt">[[[ T00 ! W-1T00 ]]]</span>        <span class="c1"># Run daily at 00:00 except on Mondays.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It is also valid to use sequences for exclusions. For example:</p>

<p>For a cycling graph with multiple validity sections for different
hours of the day, the different sections <em>add</em> to generate the
complete graph. Different graph sections can overlap (i.e. the same
hours may appear in multiple section headings) and the same tasks may
appear in multiple sections, but individual dependencies should be
unique across the entire graph. For example, the following graph defines
a duplicate prerequisite for task C:</p>

<p>Dependencies that are only valid at the initial cycle point can be written
using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">R1</span></code> notation (e.g. as in <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#initial-non-repeating-r1-tasks"><span class="std std-ref">Initial Non-Repeating (R1) Tasks</span></a>.
For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[cylc]</span>
    <span class="nv">UTC mode </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> True</span>

    <span class="nv">final cycle point </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> 20130812T00</span>
    <span class="nt">[[dependencies]]</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In the example above, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">R1</span></code> implies <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">R1/20130808T00</span></code>, so
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">prep</span></code> only runs once at that cycle point (the initial cycle point).
At that cycle point, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span></code> will have a dependence on
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">prep</span></code> - but not at subsequent cycle points.</p>
<p>However, it is possible to have a suite that has multiple effective initial
cycles - for example, one starting at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">T00</span></code> and another starting
at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">T12</span></code>. What if they need to share an initial task?</p>
<p>Let’s suppose that we add the following section to the suite example above:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[cylc]</span>
    <span class="nv">UTC mode </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> True</span>

    <span class="nv">final cycle point </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> 20130812T00</span>
    <span class="nt">[[dependencies]]</span>
        <span class="nt">[[[R1]]]</span>
            <span class="nv">graph</span><span class="s"> </span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="c">&quot;</span><span class="kd">prep</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kd">foo</span><span class="c">&quot;</span>
        <span class="nt">[[[T00]]]</span>
            <span class="nv">graph</span><span class="s"> </span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="c">&quot;</span><span class="kd">foo</span>[<span class="nb">-P1D</span>] <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kd">foo</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kd">bar</span><span class="c">&quot;</span>
        <span class="nt">[[[T12]]]</span>
            <span class="nv">graph</span><span class="s"> </span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="c">&quot;</span><span class="kd">baz</span>[<span class="nb">-P1D</span>] <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kd">baz</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kd">qux</span><span class="c">&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We’ll also say that there should be a starting dependence between
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">prep</span></code> and our new task <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">baz</span></code> - but we still want to have
a single <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">prep</span></code> task, at a single cycle.</p>
<p>We can write this using a special case of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">task[-interval]</span></code> syntax -
if the interval is null, this implies the task at the initial cycle point.</p>
<p>For example, we can write our suite like <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-test4"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 25</span></a>.</p>

<p>A different kind of requirement is displayed in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-test5"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 26</span></a>.
Usually, we want to specify additional tasks and dependencies at the initial
cycle point. What if we want our first cycle point to be entirely special,
with some tasks missing compared to subsequent cycle points?</p>
<p>In <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-test5"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 26</span></a>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bar</span></code> will not be run at the initial
cycle point, but will still run at subsequent cycle points.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[[[+PT6H/PT6H]]]</span></code> means start at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">+PT6H</span></code> (6 hours after
the initial cycle point) and then repeat every <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PT6H</span></code> (6 hours).</p>
<p>Some suites may have staggered start-up sequences where different tasks need
running once but only at specific cycle points, potentially due to differing
data sources at different cycle points with different possible initial cycle
points. To allow this cylc provides a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">min(</span> <span class="pre">)</span></code> function that can be
used as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[cylc]</span>
    <span class="nv">UTC mode </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> True</span>
<span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>
    <span class="nv">initial cycle point </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> 20100101T03</span>
    <span class="nt">[[dependencies]]</span>
        <span class="nt">[[[R1/min(T00,T12)]]]</span>
            <span class="nv">graph</span><span class="s"> </span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="c">&quot;</span><span class="kd">prep1</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kd">foo</span><span class="c">&quot;</span>
        <span class="nt">[[[R1/min(T06,T18)]]]</span>
            <span class="nv">graph</span><span class="s"> </span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="c">&quot;</span><span class="kd">prep2</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kd">foo</span><span class="c">&quot;</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In this example the initial cycle point is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">20100101T03</span></code>, so the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">prep1</span></code> task will run once at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">20100101T12</span></code> and the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">prep2</span></code> task will run once at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">20100101T06</span></code> as these are
the first cycle points after the initial cycle point in the respective
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">min(</span> <span class="pre">)</span></code> entries.</p>

<p>In addition to non-repeating and date-time cycling workflows, cylc can do

<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[scheduling]cycling</span> <span class="pre">mode</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">integer</span></code>, and specify integer values for

notation, except for the simple integer values.</p>

<h6>9.3.4.8.1. Example<a class="headerlink" href="#example" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>The tutorial illustrates integer cycling in <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#tutinteger"><span class="std std-ref">Integer Cycling</span></a>, and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;cylc-dir&gt;/etc/examples/satellite/</span></code> is a
self-contained example of a realistic use for integer cycling. It simulates
the processing of incoming satellite data: each new dataset arrives after a
random (as far as the suite is concerned) interval, and is labeled by an
arbitrary (as far as the suite is concerned) ID in the filename. A task called
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">get_data</span></code> at the top of the repeating workflow waits on the next
dataset and, when it finds one, moves it to a cycle-point-specific shared
workspace for processing by the downstream tasks. When <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">get_data.1</span></code>
finishes, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">get_data.2</span></code> triggers and begins waiting for the next
dataset at the same time as the downstream tasks in cycle point 1 are
processing the first one, and so on. In this way multiple datasets can be
processed at once if they happen to come in quickly. A single shutdown task
runs at the end of the final cycle to collate results. The suite graph is
shown in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-satellite"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 27</span></a>.</p>

<h6>9.3.4.8.2. Advanced Integer Cycling Syntax<a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-integer-cycling-syntax" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h6>
<p>The same syntax used to reference the initial and final cycle points
(introduced in <a class="reference internal" href="#referencing-the-initial-and-final-cycle-points"><span class="std std-ref">Referencing The Initial And Final Cycle Points</span></a>) for
use with date-time cycling can also be used for integer cycling. For
example you can write:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[[[ R1/^ ]]]</span>     <span class="c1"># Run once at the initial cycle point</span>
<span class="nt">[[[ R1/$ ]]]</span>     <span class="c1"># Run once at the final cycle point</span>
<span class="nt">[[[ R3/^/P2 ]]]</span>  <span class="c1"># Run three times with step two starting at the</span>
                 <span class="c1"># initial cycle point</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Likewise the syntax introduced in <a class="reference internal" href="#excluding-dates"><span class="std std-ref">Excluding Dates</span></a> for excluding
a particular point from a recurrence also works for integer cycling. For
example:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[[[ R/P4!8 ]]]</span>       <span class="c1"># Run with step 4, to the final cycle point</span>
                     <span class="c1"># but not at point 8</span>
<span class="nt">[[[ R3/3/P2!5 ]]]</span>    <span class="c1"># Run with step 2 from point 3 but not at</span>
                     <span class="c1"># point 5</span>
<span class="nt">[[[ R/+P1/P6!14 ]]]</span>  <span class="c1"># Run with step 6 from 1 step after the</span>
                     <span class="c1"># initial cycle point but not at point 14</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Multiple integer exclusions are also valid in the same way as the syntax
in <a class="reference internal" href="#excluding-dates"><span class="std std-ref">Excluding Dates</span></a>. Integer exclusions may be a list of single
integer points, an integer sequence, or a combination of both:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[[[ R/P1!(2,3,7) ]]]</span>  <span class="c1"># Run with step 1 to the final cycle point,</span>

<p>A task is said to “trigger” when it submits its job to run, as soon as all of
its dependencies (also known as its separate “triggers”) are met. Tasks can
be made to trigger off of the state of other tasks (indicated by a
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:state</span></code> qualifier on the upstream task (or family)
name in the graph) and, and off the clock, and arbitrary external events.</p>

<p>This can be used to trigger tasks that monitor other tasks once they
(the target tasks) start executing. Consider a long-running forecast model,
for instance, that generates a sequence of output files as it runs. A
postprocessing task could be launched with a start trigger on the model
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">model:start</span> <span class="pre">=&gt;</span> <span class="pre">post</span></code>) to process the model output as it
becomes available. Note, however, that there are several alternative
ways of handling this scenario: both tasks could be triggered at the
same time (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span> <span class="pre">=&gt;</span> <span class="pre">model</span> <span class="pre">&amp;</span> <span class="pre">post</span></code>), but depending on
external queue delays this could result in the monitoring task starting
to execute first; or a different postprocessing task could be
triggered off a message output for each data file
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">model:out1</span> <span class="pre">=&gt;</span> <span class="pre">post1</span></code> etc.; see <a class="reference internal" href="#messagetriggers"><span class="std std-ref">Message Triggers</span></a>), but this

<p>While cylc allows writing dependencies between two families it is important to
consider the number of dependencies this will generate. In the following
example, each member of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FAM2</span></code> has dependencies pointing at all the
members of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FAM1</span></code>.</p>

    <span class="kd">FAM1</span><span class="c">:</span><span class="kd">succeed</span><span class="c">-</span><span class="kd">any</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kd">FAM2</span>
                <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Expanding this out, you generate <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">N</span> <span class="pre">*</span> <span class="pre">M</span></code> dependencies, where
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">N</span></code> is the number of members of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FAM1</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">M</span></code> is
the number of members of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FAM2</span></code>. This can result in high memory use
as the number of members of these families grows, potentially rendering the
suite impractical for running on some systems.</p>
<p>You can greatly reduce the number of dependencies generated in these situations
by putting dummy tasks in the graphing to represent the state of the family you
want to trigger off. For example, if <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FAM2</span></code> should trigger off any
member of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FAM1</span></code> succeeding you can create a dummy task
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FAM1_succeed_any_marker</span></code> and place a dependency on it as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>

<p>This graph generates only <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">N</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">M</span></code> dependencies, which takes

<p>Typically most tasks in a suite will trigger off others in the same
cycle point, but some may depend on others with other cycle points.
This notably applies to warm-cycled forecast models, which depend on
their own previous instances (see below); but other kinds of inter-cycle
dependence are possible too <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id12" id="id6">[2]</a> . Here’s how to express this
kind of relationship in cylc:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[dependencies]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[PT6H]]</span>
        <span class="c1"># B triggers off A in the previous cycle point</span>
        <span class="nv">graph</span><span class="s"> </span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="c">&quot;</span><span class="kd">A</span>[<span class="nb">-PT6H</span>] <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kd">B</span><span class="c">&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>inter-cycle and trigger type (or message trigger) notation can be
combined:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># B triggers if A in the previous cycle point fails:</span>
<span class="nv">graph</span><span class="s"> </span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="c">&quot;</span><span class="kd">A</span>[<span class="nb">-PT6H</span>]<span class="c">:</span><span class="kd">fail</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kd">B</span><span class="c">&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>At suite start-up inter-cycle triggers refer to a previous cycle point
that does not exist. This does not cause the dependent task to wait
indefinitely, however, because cylc ignores triggers that reach back
beyond the initial cycle point. That said, the presence of an
inter-cycle trigger does normally imply that something special has to
happen at start-up. If a model depends on its own previous instance for
restart files, for instance, then an initial set of restart files has to be
generated somehow or the first model task will presumably fail with
missing input files. There are several ways to handle this in cylc
using different kinds of one-off (non-cycling) tasks that run at suite
start-up. They are illustrated in <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#tutintercyclepointtriggers"><span class="std std-ref">Inter-Cycle Triggers</span></a>; to
summarize here briefly:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">R1</span></code> tasks (recommended):</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>

</ul>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">R1</span></code>, or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">R1/date-time</span></code> tasks are the recommended way to
specify unusual start up conditions. They allow you to specify a clean
distinction between the dependencies of initial cycles and the dependencies
of the subsequent cycles.</p>
<p>Initial tasks can be used for real model cold-start processes, whereby a
warm-cycled model at any given cycle point can in principle have its inputs
satisfied by a previous instance of itself, <em>or</em> by an initial task with
(nominally) the same cycle point.</p>
<p>In effect, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">R1</span></code> task masquerades as the previous-cycle-point trigger
of its associated cycling task. At suite start-up initial tasks will
trigger the first cycling tasks, and thereafter the inter-cycle trigger
will take effect.</p>
<p>If a task has a dependency on another task in a different cycle point, the
dependency can be written using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[offset]</span></code> syntax such as
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[-PT12H]</span></code> in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo[-PT12H]</span> <span class="pre">=&gt;</span> <span class="pre">foo</span></code>. This means that
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span></code> at the current cycle point depends on a previous instance of
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span></code> at 12 hours before the current cycle point. Unlike the
cycling section headings (e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[[[T00,T12]]]</span></code>), dependencies
assume that relative times are relative to the current cycle point, not the
initial cycle point.</p>
<p>However, it can be useful to have specific dependencies on tasks at or near
the initial cycle point. You can switch the context of the offset to be
the initial cycle point by using the caret symbol: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">^</span></code>.</p>
<p>For example, you can write <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo[^]</span></code> to mean foo at the initial
cycle point, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo[^+PT6H]</span></code> to mean foo 6 hours after the initial
cycle point. Usually, this kind of dependency will only apply in a limited
number of cycle points near the start of the suite, so you may want to write
it in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">R1</span></code>-based cycling sections. Here’s the example inter-cycle
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">R1</span></code> suite from above again.</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can see there is a dependence on the initial <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">R1</span></code> task
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">prep</span></code> for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span></code> at the first <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">T00</span></code> cycle point,
and at the first <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">T12</span></code> cycle point. Thereafter, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span></code> just
depends on its previous (12 hours ago) instance.</p>
<p>Finally, it is also possible to have a dependency on a task at a specific cycle
point.</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>

<p>However, in a long running suite, a repeating cycle should avoid having a

</div>
<p>By default, date-time cycle points are not connected to the real time “wall
clock”. They are just labels that are passed to task jobs (e.g. to
initialize an atmospheric model run with a particular date-time value). In real
time cycling systems, however, some tasks - typically those near the top of the
graph in each cycle - need to trigger at or near the time when their cycle point
is equal to the real clock date-time.</p>
<p>So <em>clock triggers</em> allow tasks to trigger at (or after, depending on other
triggers) a wall clock time expressed as an offset from cycle point:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo[2015-08-23T00]</span></code> would trigger (other dependencies allowing)
when the wall clock time reaches <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">2015-08-23T02</span></code>. Clock-trigger
offsets are normally positive, to trigger some time <em>after</em> the wall-clock
time is equal to task cycle point.</p>
<p>Clock-triggers have no effect on scheduling if a suite is running sufficiently
far behind the clock (e.g. after a delay, or because it is processing archived
historical data) that the trigger times, which are relative to task cycle
point, have already passed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="clock-expire-triggers">
<span id="clockexpiretasks"></span><h5>9.3.5.15. Clock-Expire Triggers<a class="headerlink" href="#clock-expire-triggers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Tasks can be configured to <em>expire</em> - i.e. to skip job submission and
enter the <em>expired</em> state - if they are too far behind the wall clock when
they become ready to run, and other tasks can trigger off this. As a possible
use case, consider a cycling task that copies the latest of a set of files to
overwrite the previous set: if the task is delayed by more than one cycle there
may be no point in running it because the freshly copied files will just be
overwritten immediately by the next task instance as the suite catches back up
to real time operation. Clock-expire tasks are configured like clock-trigger
tasks, with a date-time offset relative to cycle point (<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#clockexpireref"><span class="std std-ref">[scheduling] -&gt; [[special tasks]] -&gt; clock-expire</span></a>).
The offset should be positive to make the task expire if the wall-clock time
has gone beyond the cycle point. Triggering off an expired task typically
requires suicide triggers to remove the workflow that runs if the task has not
expired. Here a task called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">copy</span></code> expires, and its downstream
workflow is skipped, if it is more than one day behind the wall-clock (see also
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">etc/examples/clock-expire</span></code>):</p>

<h4>9.3.7. How The Graph Determines Task Instantiation<a class="headerlink" href="#how-the-graph-determines-task-instantiation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A graph trigger pair like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span> <span class="pre">=&gt;</span> <span class="pre">bar</span></code> determines the existence and
prerequisites (dependencies) of the downstream task <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bar</span></code>, for
the cycle points defined by the associated graph section heading. In general it
does not say anything about the dependencies or existence of the upstream task
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span></code>. However <em>if the trigger has no cycle point offset</em> Cylc
will infer that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bar</span></code> must exist at the same cycle points as
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span></code>. This is a convenience to allow this:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">graph</span><span class="s"> </span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="c">&quot;</span><span class="kd">foo</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kd">bar</span><span class="c">&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>to be written as shorthand for this:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">graph</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span><span class="kd">foo</span>
           <span class="kd">foo</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kd">bar</span><span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>(where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span></code> by itself means <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;nothing&gt;</span> <span class="pre">=&gt;</span> <span class="pre">foo</span></code>, i.e. the
task exists at these cycle points but has no prerequisites - although other
prerequisites may be defined for it in other parts of the graph).</p>
<p><em>Cylc does not infer the existence of the upstream task in offset
triggers</em> like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo[-P1D]</span> <span class="pre">=&gt;</span> <span class="pre">bar</span></code> because, as explained in
<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#cylc-6-migration-implicit-cycling"><span class="std std-ref">No Implicit Creation of Tasks by Offset Triggers</span></a>, a typo in the offset interval
should generate an error rather than silently creating tasks on an erroneous
cycling sequence.</p>
<p>As a result you need to be careful not to define inter-cycle dependencies that
cannot be satisfied at run time. Suite validation catches this kind of error if
the existence of the cycle offset task is not defined anywhere at all:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>
    <span class="nv">initial cycle point </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> 2020</span>

<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ cylc validate SUITE
<span class="s1">&#39;ERROR: No cycling sequences defined for foo&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To fix this, use another line in the graph to tell Cylc to define
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span></code> at each cycle point:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>
    <span class="nv">initial cycle point </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> 2020</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>But validation does not catch this kind of error if the offset task
is defined only on a different cycling sequence:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>
    <span class="nv">initial cycle point </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> 2020</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This suite will validate OK, but it will stall at runtime with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bar</span></code>
waiting on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo[-P1Y]</span></code> at the intermediate years where it does not
exist. The offset <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[-P1Y]</span></code> is presumably an error (it should be
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[-P2Y]</span></code>), or else another graph line is needed to generate
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span></code> instances on the yearly sequence:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>
    <span class="nv">initial cycle point </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> 2020</span>

<h4>9.4.2. Root - Runtime Defaults<a class="headerlink" href="#root-runtime-defaults" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The root namespace, at the base of the inheritance hierarchy,
provides default configuration for all tasks in the suite.
Most root items are unset by default, but some have default values
sufficient to allow test suites to be defined by dependency graph alone.
The <em>script</em> item, for example, defaults to code that
prints a message then sleeps for between 1 and 15 seconds and
exits. Default values are documented with each item in
<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#suitercreference"><span class="std std-ref">Suite.rc Reference</span></a>. You can override the defaults or
provide your own defaults by explicitly configuring the root namespace.</p>

<h4>9.4.5. Runtime Inheritance - Multiple<a class="headerlink" href="#runtime-inheritance-multiple" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>If a namespace inherits from multiple parents the linear order of

so-called <em>C3 algorithm</em> used to find the linear <em>method

<p>The linear precedence order of ancestors is computed for each namespace
using the C3 algorithm. Then any runtime items that are explicitly
configured in the suite configuration are “inherited” up the linearized
hierarchy for each task, starting at the root namespace: if a particular
item is defined at multiple levels in the hierarchy, the level nearest
the final task namespace takes precedence. Finally, root namespace
defaults are applied for every item that has not been configured in the
inheritance process (this is more efficient than carrying the full dense
namespace structure through from root from the beginning).</p>

all items including those in the environment sub-sections which,
strictly speaking, are not “environment variables” until they are

<p>Then angle brackets denote use of these parameters throughout the suite

<p>expands to these concrete task names:</p>

<p>and this parameterized name:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>proc&lt;obs&gt;  # for obs = ship, buoy, plane

</div>
<p>By default, to avoid any ambiguity, the parameter name appears in the expanded
task names for integer values, but not for string values. For example,

<p>Any number of parameters can be used at once. This parameterization:</p>

For example, the default template for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">p</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">9..10</span></code> would be
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_p%(p)02d</span></code>, so that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo&lt;p&gt;</span></code> would become <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo_p09,</span> <span class="pre">foo_p10</span></code>.
If negative values are present in the parameter list, the
default template will include the sign.
For example, the default template for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">p</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">-1..1</span></code> would be
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_p%(p)+02d</span></code>, so that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo&lt;p&gt;</span></code> would become
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo_p-1,</span> <span class="pre">foo_p+0,</span> <span class="pre">foo_p+1</span></code>.</p>
<p>To get thicker padding and/or alternate suffixes, use a template. E.g.:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[cylc]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[parameters]]</span>
        <span class="nv">i </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> 1..9</span>
        <span class="nv">p </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> 3..14</span>

        <span class="nv">i </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> _i%(i)02d</span>  <span class="c1"># suffixes = _i01, _i02, ..., _i09</span>
        <span class="c1"># A double-percent gives a literal percent character</span>
        <span class="nv">p </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> %%p%(p)03d</span>  <span class="c1"># suffixes = %p003, %p004, ..., %p013, %p014</span>

<p>These variables allow tasks to determine which member of a parameterized

<p>You can also define custom variables and string templates for parameter value

<p>The two workflows are shown together in <a class="reference internal" href="#fig-eg2"><span class="std std-numref">Fig. 33</span></a>.
They both achieve the same result, and both can
include special tasks at the start, end, or
anywhere in between. But as noted earlier the parameterized version has
several disadvantages: it must be finite in extent and not too large; the
date-time arithmetic has to be done by the user; and the full extent of the
workflow will be visible at all times as the suite runs.</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The inter-cycle trigger connects the first chunk in each cycle point
to the last chunk in the previous cycle point. Of course it would be simpler
to just use 3-monthly cycling:</p>
<div class="last highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>

</div>
<p>Here’s a possible valid use-case for mixed cycling: consider a portable
date-time cycling workflow of model jobs that can each take too long to run on
some supported platforms. This could be handled without changing the cycling
structure of the suite by splitting the run (at each cycle point) into a
variable number of shorter steps, using more steps on less powerful hosts.</p>

<p>In cycling workflows cylc ignores anything earlier than the suite initial
cycle point. So this graph:</p>

<p>Similarly, parameter offsets are ignored if they extend beyond the start

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The initial cut-off applies to every parameter list, but only
to cycle point sequences that start at the suite initial cycle point.
Therefore it may be somewhat easier to use parameterized cycling if you
need multiple date-time sequences <em>with different start points</em> in the
same suite. We plan to allow this sequence-start simplification for any
date-time sequence in the future, not just at the suite initial point,
but it needs to be optional because delayed-start cycling tasks
sometimes need to trigger off earlier cycling tasks.</p>

<span id="id9"></span><h3>9.6. Jinja2<a class="headerlink" href="#jinja" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">This section needs to be revised - the Parameterized Task feature
introduced in cylc-6.11.0 (see <a class="reference internal" href="#parameterized-tasks-label"><span class="std std-ref">Parameterized Tasks</span></a>) provides
a cleaner way to auto-generate tasks without coding messy Jinja2 loops.</p>
</div>
<p>Cylc has built in support for the Jinja2 template processor in suite
configurations. Jinja2 variables, mathematical expressions, loop control
structures, conditional logic, etc., are automatically processed to
generate the final suite configuration seen by cylc.</p>
<p>The need for Jinja2 processing must be declared with a hash-bang
comment as the first line of the suite.rc file:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="ch">#!jinja2</span>
<span class="c1"># ...</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Potential uses for this include automatic generation of repeated groups
of similar tasks and dependencies, and inclusion or exclusion of entire
suite sections according to the value of a single flag. Consider a
large complicated operational suite and several related parallel test
suites with slightly different task content and structure (the parallel
suites, for instance, might take certain large input files from the
operation or the archive rather than downloading them again) - these can
now be maintained as a single master suite configuration that reconfigures
itself according to the value of a flag variable indicating the intended use.</p>
<p>Template processing is the first thing done on parsing a suite
configuration so Jinja2 expressions can appear anywhere in the file (inside
strings and namespace headings, for example).</p>
<p>Jinja2 is <a class="reference external" href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs">well documented</a>, so here
we just provide an example suite that uses it. The meaning of the
embedded Jinja2 code should be reasonably self-evident to anyone familiar
with standard programming techniques.</p>

<p>And finally, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">jinja2.cities</span></code> example uses variables,
includes or excludes special cleanup tasks according to the value of a
logical flag, and it automatically generates all dependencies and family
relationships for a group of tasks that is repeated for each city in the
suite. To add a new city and associated tasks and dependencies simply
add the city name to list at the top of the file. The suite is graphed,

<p>This functionality is not provided by Jinja2 by default, but cylc
automatically imports the user environment to template’s global namespace
(see <a class="reference internal" href="#customjinja2filters"><span class="std std-ref">Custom Jinja2 Filters, Tests and Globals</span></a>) in a dictionary structure called
<em>environ</em>. A usage example:</p>

<span class="nt">[runtime]</span>

</pre></div>

<p>This example is emphasizes that <em>the environment is read on the suite

instance, read at task run time on the task host.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="custom-jinja2-filters-tests-and-globals">
<span id="customjinja2filters"></span><h4>9.6.2. Custom Jinja2 Filters, Tests and Globals<a class="headerlink" href="#custom-jinja2-filters-tests-and-globals" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Jinja2 has three different namespaces used to separate “globals”,
“filters” and “tests”. Globals are template-wide accessible variables
and functions. Cylc extends this namespace with “environ” dictionary and
“raise” and “assert” functions for raising exceptions
(see <a class="reference internal" href="#jinja2raisingexceptions"><span class="std std-ref">Raising Exceptions</span></a>).</p>
<p>Filters can be used to modify variable values and are applied using pipe
notation. For example, the built-in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">trim</span></code> filter strips leading
and trailing white space from a string:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">{% set MyString = &quot;   dog   &quot; %}</span>
<span class="cp">{{ MyString | trim() }}</span>  <span class="c1"># &quot;dog&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Additionally, variable values can be tested using “is” keyword followed by
the name of the test, e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">VARIABLE</span> <span class="pre">is</span> <span class="pre">defined</span></code>.
See official Jinja2 documentation for available built-in globals, filters
and tests.</p>
<p>Cylc also supports custom Jinja2 globals, filters and tests. A custom global,
filter or test is a single Python function in a source file with the same name
as the function (plus “.py” extension) and stored in one of the following
locations:</p>

<p>In the argument list of filter or test function, the first argument is
the variable value to be “filtered” or “tested”, respectively, and
subsequent arguments can be whatever else is needed. Currently there are three
custom filters:</p>
<div class="section" id="pad">
<h5>9.6.2.1. pad<a class="headerlink" href="#pad" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The “pad” filter is for padding string values to some
constant length with a fill character - useful for generating task names
and related values in ensemble suites:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">{% for i in range(0,100) %}</span>  <span class="c1"># 0, 1, ..., 99</span>

<span class="cp">{% endfor %}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="strftime">
<h5>9.6.2.2. strftime<a class="headerlink" href="#strftime" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The “strftime” filter can be used to format ISO8601 date-time strings using
an strftime string.</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">{% set START_CYCLE = &#39;10661004T08+01&#39; %}</span>
<span class="cp">{{ START_CYCLE | strftime(&#39;%H&#39;) }}</span>  <span class="c1"># 00</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{{START_CYCLE</span> <span class="pre">|</span> <span class="pre">strftime('%Y')}}</span></code> - 1066</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{{START_CYCLE</span> <span class="pre">|</span> <span class="pre">strftime('%m')}}</span></code> - 10</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{{START_CYCLE</span> <span class="pre">|</span> <span class="pre">strftime('%d')}}</span></code> - 14</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{{START_CYCLE</span> <span class="pre">|</span> <span class="pre">strftime('%H:%M:%S</span> <span class="pre">%z')}}</span></code> - 08:00:00 +01</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also possible to parse non-standard date-time strings by passing a
strptime string as the second argument.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{{'12,30,2000'</span> <span class="pre">|</span> <span class="pre">strftime('%m',</span> <span class="pre">'%m,%d,%Y')}}</span></code> - 12</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{{'1066/10/14</span> <span class="pre">08:00:00'</span> <span class="pre">|</span> <span class="pre">strftime('%Y%m%dT%H',</span> <span class="pre">'%Y/%m/%d</span> <span class="pre">%H:%M:%S')}}</span></code> - 10661014T08</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="duration-as">
<h5>9.6.2.3. duration_as<a class="headerlink" href="#duration-as" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The “duration_as” filter can be used to format ISO8601 duration
strings as a floating-point number of several different units.  Units
for the conversion can be specified in a case-insensitive short or long
form:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Seconds - “s” or “seconds”</li>
<li>Minutes - “m” or “minutes”</li>
<li>Hours - “h” or “hours”</li>
<li>Days - “d” or “days”</li>
<li>Weeks - “w” or “weeks”</li>
</ul>
<p>Within the suite, this becomes:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="cp">{% set CYCLE_INTERVAL = &#39;PT1D&#39; %}</span>
<span class="cp">{{ CYCLE_INTERVAL | duration_as(&#39;h&#39;) }}</span>  <span class="c1"># 24.0</span>
<span class="cp">{% set CYCLE_SUBINTERVAL = &#39;PT30M&#39; %}</span>
<span class="cp">{{ CYCLE_SUBINTERVAL | duration_as(&#39;hours&#39;) }}</span>  <span class="c1"># 0.5</span>
<span class="cp">{% set CYCLE_INTERVAL = &#39;PT1D&#39; %}</span>
<span class="cp">{{ CYCLE_INTERVAL | duration_as(&#39;s&#39;) }}</span>  <span class="c1"># 86400.0</span>
<span class="cp">{% set CYCLE_SUBINTERVAL = &#39;PT30M&#39; %}</span>
<span class="cp">{{ CYCLE_SUBINTERVAL | duration_as(&#39;seconds&#39;) }}</span>  <span class="c1"># 1800.0</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>While the filtered value is a floating-point number, it is often required to
supply an integer to suite entities (e.g. environment variables) that require
it.  This is accomplished by chaining filters:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{{CYCLE_INTERVAL</span> <span class="pre">|</span> <span class="pre">duration_as('h')</span> <span class="pre">|</span> <span class="pre">int}}</span></code> - 24</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">{{CYCLE_SUBINTERVAL</span> <span class="pre">|</span> <span class="pre">duration_as('h')</span> <span class="pre">|</span> <span class="pre">int}}</span></code> - 0</li>

<p>For basic usage the difference between Jinja2 and EmPy amounts to a different
markup syntax with little else to distinguish them. EmPy might be preferable,
however, in cases where more complicated processing logic have to be
implemented.</p>
<p>EmPy is a system for embedding Python expressions and statements in template
text. It makes the full power of Python language and its ecosystem easily
accessible from within the template. This might be desirable for several
reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>no need to learn different language and its idiosyncrasies just for
writing template logic</li>
<li>availability of lambda functions, list and dictionary comprehensions
can make template code smaller and more readable compared to Jinja2</li>
<li>natural and straightforward integration with Python package ecosystem</li>
<li>no two-language barrier between writing template logic and processing
extensions makes it easier to refactor and maintain the template code
as its complexity grows - inline pieces of Python code can be
gathered into subroutines and eventually into separate modules and
packages in a seamless manner.</li>

<h4>9.6.9. Omitting Tasks At Runtime<a class="headerlink" href="#omitting-tasks-at-runtime" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>It is sometimes convenient to omit certain tasks from the suite at
runtime without actually deleting their definitions from the suite.</p>
<p>Defining <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[runtime]</span></code> properties for tasks that do not appear in the suite
graph results in verbose-mode validation warnings that the tasks are
disabled. They cannot be used because the suite graph is what defines
their dependencies and valid cycle points. Nevertheless, it is legal to
leave these orphaned runtime sections in the suite configuration because it
allows you to temporarily remove tasks from the suite by simply
commenting them out of the graph.</p>
<p>To omit a task from the suite at runtime but still leave it fully
defined and available for use (by insertion or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">submit</span></code>)
use one or both of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[scheduling][[special</span> <span class="pre">task]]</span></code> lists, <em>include at
start-up</em> or <em>exclude at start-up</em> (documented in <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#iasu"><span class="std std-ref">[scheduling] -&gt; [[special tasks]] -&gt; include at start-up</span></a>
and <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#easu"><span class="std std-ref">[scheduling] -&gt; [[special tasks]] -&gt; exclude at start-up</span></a>). Then the graph still defines the
validity of the tasks and their dependencies, but they are not actually
loaded into the suite at start-up. Other tasks that depend on the
omitted ones, if any, will have to wait on their insertion at a later
time or otherwise be triggered manually.</p>
<p>Finally, with Jinja2 (<a class="reference internal" href="#jinja"><span class="std std-ref">Jinja2</span></a>) you can radically alter
suite structure by including or excluding tasks from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[scheduling]</span></code>
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[runtime]</span></code> sections according to the value of a single logical flag
defined at the top of the suite.</p>

<h3>9.7. Naked Dummy Tasks And Strict Validation<a class="headerlink" href="#naked-dummy-tasks-and-strict-validation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A <em>naked dummy task</em> appears in the suite graph but has no
explicit runtime configuration section. Such tasks automatically
inherit the default “dummy task” configuration from the root
namespace. This is very useful because it allows functional suites to
be mocked up quickly for test and demonstration purposes by simply
defining the graph. It is somewhat dangerous, however, because there
is no way to distinguish an intentional naked dummy task from one
generated by typographic error: misspelling a task name in the graph
results in a new naked dummy task replacing the intended task in the
affected trigger expression; and misspelling a task name in a runtime
section heading results in the intended task becoming a dummy task
itself (by divorcing it from its intended runtime config section).</p>
<p>To avoid this problem any dummy task used in a real suite should not be
naked - i.e. it should have an explicit entry in under the runtime
section of the suite configuration, even if the section is empty. This
results in exactly the same dummy task behaviour, via implicit
inheritance from root, but it allows use of
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">validate</span> <span class="pre">--strict</span></code>
to catch errors in task names by failing the suite if any naked dummy
tasks are detected.</p>

<h3>10.4. Aborting Job Scripts on Error<a class="headerlink" href="#aborting-job-scripts-on-error" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Task job scripts use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">set</span> <span class="pre">-x</span></code> to abort on any error, and
trap ERR, EXIT, and SIGTERM to send task failed messages back to the
suite server program before aborting. Other scripts called from job scripts
should therefore abort with standard non-zero exit status on error, to trigger
the job script error trap.</p>
<p>To prevent a command that is expected to generate a non-zero exit status from
triggering the exit trap, protect it with a control statement such as:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> cmp FILE1 FILE2<span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>
    :  <span class="c1"># success: do stuff</span>
<span class="k">else</span>
    :  <span class="c1"># failure: do other stuff</span>
<span class="k">fi</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Task job scripts also use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">set</span> <span class="pre">-u</span></code> to abort on referencing any
undefined variable (useful for picking up typos); and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">set</span> <span class="pre">-o</span> <span class="pre">pipefail</span></code>
to abort if any part of a pipe fails (by default the shell only returns the
exit status of the final command in a pipeline).</p>
<div class="section" id="custom-failure-messages">
<h4>10.4.1. Custom Failure Messages<a class="headerlink" href="#custom-failure-messages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Critical events normally warrant aborting a job script rather than just sending
a message. As described just above, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">exit</span> <span class="pre">1</span></code> or any failing command
not protected by the surrounding scripting will cause a job script to abort and
report failure to the suite server program, potentially triggering a
<em>failed</em> task event handler.</p>
<p>For failures detected by the scripting you could send a critical message back
before aborting, potentially triggering a <em>critical</em> task event handler:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">if</span> ! /bin/false<span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">then</span>

function:</p>

<span id="detachingjobs"></span><h3>10.5. Avoid Detaching Processes<a class="headerlink" href="#avoid-detaching-processes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If a task script starts background sub-processes and does not wait on them, or
internally submits jobs to a batch scheduler and then exits immediately, the
detached processes will not be visible to cylc and the task will appear to
finish when the top-level script finishes. You will need to modify scripts
like this to make them execute all sub-processes in the foreground (or use the
shell <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wait</span></code> command to wait on them before exiting) and to prevent
job submission commands from returning before the job completes (e.g.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">llsubmit</span> <span class="pre">-s</span></code> for Loadleveler,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">qsub</span> <span class="pre">-sync</span> <span class="pre">yes</span></code> for Sun Grid Engine, and

<p>If this is not possible - perhaps you don’t have control over the script

<p>When a task is ready to run cylc generates a filename root to be used
for the task job script and log files. The filename containing the task
name, cycle point, and a submit number that increments if the same task is
re-triggered multiple times:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># task job script:</span>
~/cylc-run/tut/oneoff/basic/log/job/1/hello/01/job
<span class="c1"># task stdout:</span>

<span class="c1"># task stderr:</span>
~/cylc-run/tut/oneoff/basic/log/job/1/hello/01/job.err
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>How the stdout and stderr streams are directed into these files depends
on the batch system. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">background</span></code> method just uses
appropriate output redirection on the command line, as shown above. The
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">loadleveler</span></code> method writes appropriate directives to the job
script that is submitted to loadleveler.</p>
<p>Cylc obviously has no control over the stdout and stderr output from
tasks that do their own internal output management (e.g. tasks
that submit internal jobs and direct the associated output to other
files). For less internally complex tasks, however, the files referred
to here will be complete task job logs.</p>
<p>Some batch systems, such as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pbs</span></code>, redirect a job’s stdout
and stderr streams to a separate cache area while the job is running. The
contents are only copied to the normal locations when the job completes. This
means that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">cat-log</span></code> or the gcylc GUI will be unable to find the
job’s stdout and stderr streams while the job is running. Some sites with these
batch systems are known to provide commands for viewing and/or
tail-follow a job’s stdout and stderr streams that are redirected to these
cache areas. If this is the case at your site, you can configure cylc to make
use of the provided commands by adding some settings to the global site/user
config. E.g.:</p>

<div class="section" id="job-polling">
<h3>11.4. Job Polling<a class="headerlink" href="#job-polling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For supported batch systems, one-way polling can be used to determine actual
job status: the suite server program executes a process on the task host, by
non-interactive ssh, to interrogate the batch queueing system there, and to
read a <em>status file</em> that is automatically generated by the task job script
as it runs.</p>
<p>Polling may be required to update the suite state correctly after unusual
events such as a machine being rebooted with tasks running on it, or network
problems that prevent task messages from getting back to the suite host.</p>
<p>Tasks can be polled on demand by right-clicking on them in gcylc or using the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">poll</span></code> command.</p>
<p>Tasks are polled automatically, once, if they timeout while queueing in a
batch scheduler and submission timeout is set. (See <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#taskeventhandling"><span class="std std-ref">[runtime] -&gt; [[__NAME__]] -&gt; [[[events]]]</span></a>
for how to configure timeouts).</p>
<p>Tasks are polled multiple times, where necessary, when they exceed their
execution time limits. These are normally set with some initial delays to allow
the batch systems to kill the jobs.
(See <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#executiontimelimitpollingintervals"><span class="std std-ref">[hosts] -&gt; [[HOST]] -&gt; [[[batch systems]]] -&gt; [[[[SYSTEM]]]] -&gt; execution time limit polling intervals</span></a> for how to configure the polling
intervals).</p>
<p>Any tasks recorded in the <em>submitted</em> or <em>running</em> states at suite
restart are automatically polled to determine what happened to them while the
suite was down.</p>
<p>Regular polling can also be configured as a health check on tasks submitted to
hosts that are known to be flaky, or as the sole method of determining task
status on hosts that do not allow task messages to be routed back to the suite
host.</p>
<p>To use polling instead of task-to-suite messaging set
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">task</span> <span class="pre">communication</span> <span class="pre">method</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">poll</span></code>
in cylc site and user global config (see <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#task-comms-method"><span class="std std-ref">[hosts] -&gt; [[HOST]] -&gt; task communication method</span></a>).
The default polling intervals can be overridden for all suites there too
(see <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#submission-polling"><span class="std std-ref">[hosts] -&gt; [[HOST]] -&gt; submission polling intervals</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#execution-polling"><span class="std std-ref">[hosts] -&gt; [[HOST]] -&gt; execution polling intervals</span></a>), or in specific
suite configurations (in which case polling will be done regardless of the
task communication method configured for the host;
see <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#submissionpollingintervals"><span class="std std-ref">[runtime] -&gt; [[__NAME__]] -&gt; [[[job]]] -&gt; submission polling intervals</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#executionpollingintervals"><span class="std std-ref">[runtime] -&gt; [[__NAME__]] -&gt; [[[job]]] -&gt; execution polling intervals</span></a>).</p>
<p>Note that regular polling is not as efficient as task messaging in updating
task status, and it should be used sparingly in large suites.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">For polling to work correctly, the batch queueing system must have a
job listing command for listing your jobs, and that the job listing must
display job IDs as they are returned by the batch queueing system submit
command. For example, for pbs, moab and sge, the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">qstat</span></code> command
should list jobs with their IDs displayed in exactly the same format as they
are returned by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">qsub</span></code> command.</p>

<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">execution</span> <span class="pre">timeout</span> <span class="pre">event</span> <span class="pre">handler</span></code> will only be called if the job has
not completed after the final poll (by default, 10 min after the time limit).
This should only happen if the submission method you are using is not enforcing
wallclock limits (unlikely) or you are unable to contact the machine to confirm
the job status.</p>
<p>If you specify an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">execution</span> <span class="pre">timeout</span></code> and not an
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">execution</span> <span class="pre">time</span> <span class="pre">limit</span></code> then the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">execution</span> <span class="pre">timeout</span> <span class="pre">event</span> <span class="pre">handler</span></code> will be called as soon as the
specified time is reached. The job will also be polled to check its latest
status (possibly resulting in an update in its status and the calling of the
relevant event handler). This behaviour is deprecated, which users should avoid
using.</p>

<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">This is a new capability and its suite configuration
interface may change somewhat in future releases - see Current
Limitations below in <a class="reference internal" href="#current-trigger-function-limitations"><span class="std std-ref">Current Limitations</span></a>.</p>
</div>
<p>External triggers allow tasks to trigger directly off of external events, which
is often preferable to implementing long-running polling tasks in the workflow.
The triggering mechanism described in this section replaces an older and less
powerful one documented in <a class="reference internal" href="#old-style-external-triggers"><span class="std std-ref">Old-Style External Triggers (Deprecated)</span></a>.</p>
<p>If you can write a Python function to check the status of an external
condition or event, the suite server program can call it at configurable
intervals until it reports success, at which point dependent tasks can trigger
and data returned by the function will be passed to the job environments of
those tasks. Functions can be written for triggering off of almost anything,
such as delivery of a new dataset, creation of a new entry in a database
table, or appearance of new data availability notifications in a message
broker.</p>
<p>External triggers are visible in suite visualizations as bare graph nodes (just
the trigger names). They are plotted against all dependent tasks, not in a
cycle point specific way like tasks. This is because external triggers may or
may not be cycle point (or even task name) specific - it depends on the
arguments passed to the corresponding trigger functions. For example, if an
external trigger does not depend on task name or cycle point it will only be
called once - albeit repeatedly until satisfied - for the entire suite run,
after which the function result will be remembered for all dependent tasks
throughout the suite run.</p>
<p>Several built-in external trigger functions are located in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;cylc-dir&gt;/lib/cylc/xtriggers/</span></code>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>clock triggers - see <a class="reference internal" href="#built-in-clock-triggers"><span class="std std-ref">Built-in Clock Triggers</span></a></li>
<li>inter-suite triggers - see <a class="reference internal" href="#built-in-suite-state-triggers"><span class="std std-ref">Built-in Suite State Triggers</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p>Trigger functions are normal Python functions, with certain constraints as
described below in:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>custom trigger functions - see <a class="reference internal" href="#custom-trigger-functions"><span class="std std-ref">Custom Trigger Functions</span></a></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="built-in-clock-triggers">
<span id="id2"></span><h3>12.1. Built-in Clock Triggers<a class="headerlink" href="#built-in-clock-triggers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>These are more transparent (exposed in the graph) and efficient (shared among
dependent tasks) than the older clock triggers described
in <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#clocktriggertasks"><span class="std std-ref">Clock Triggers</span></a>. (However we don’t recommend wholesale conversion
to the new method yet, until its interface has stabilized -
see <a class="reference internal" href="#current-trigger-function-limitations"><span class="std std-ref">Current Limitations</span></a>.)</p>
<p>Clock triggers, unlike other trigger functions, are executed synchronously in
the main process. The clock trigger function signature looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">wall_clock</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">offset</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">None</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">offset</span></code> argument is a date-time duration (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PT1H</span></code> is 1
hour) relative to the dependent task’s cycle point (automatically passed to the
function via a second argument not shown above).</p>
<p>In the following suite, task <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span></code> has a daily cycle point sequence,
and each task instance can trigger once the wall clock time has passed its
cycle point value by one hour:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>
    <span class="nv">initial cycle point </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> 2018-01-01</span>
    <span class="nt">[[xtriggers]]</span>
        <span class="nv">clock_1 </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> wall_clock(offset=PT1H):PT10S</span>

    <span class="nt">[[foo]]</span>
        <span class="nv">script </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> run-foo.sh</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Notice that the short label <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clock_1</span></code> is used to represent the
trigger function in the graph. The function call interval, which determines how
often the suite server program checks the clock, is optional.  Here it is
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PT10S</span></code> (i.e. 10 seconds, which is also the default value).</p>
<p>Argument keywords can be omitted if called in the right order, so the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">clock_1</span></code> trigger can also be declared like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[[xtriggers]]</span>
    <span class="nv">clock_1 </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> wall_clock(PT1H)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Finally, a zero-offset clock trigger does not need to be declared under
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[xtriggers]</span></code> section:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>

<p>The first three arguments are compulsory; they single out the target suite name
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">suite</span></code>) task name (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">task</span></code>) and cycle point
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">point</span></code>). The function arguments mirror the arguments and options of

<p>Try starting the downstream suite first, then the upstream, and
watch what happens.
In each cycle point the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&#64;upstream</span></code> trigger in the downstream suite
waits on the task <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span></code> (with the same cycle point) in the upstream
suite to emit the <em>data ready</em> message.</p>
<p>Some important points to note about this:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the function call interval, which determines how often the suite
server program checks the clock, is optional. Here it is
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PT10S</span></code> (i.e. 10 seconds, which is also the default value).</li>
<li>the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">suite_state</span></code> trigger function, like the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">suite-state</span></code> command, must have read-access to the upstream
suite’s public database.</li>
<li>the cycle point argument is supplied by a string template
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">%(point)s</span></code>. The string templates available to trigger function
arguments are described in <a class="reference internal" href="#custom-trigger-functions"><span class="std std-ref">Custom Trigger Functions</span></a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The return value of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">suite_state</span></code> trigger function looks like
this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">results</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">satisified</span></code> variable is boolean (value True or False, depending
on whether or not the trigger condition was found to be satisfied). The
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">results</span></code> dictionary contains the names and values of all of the

unique trigger label (“upstream” here) and passed to the environment of
dependent task jobs (the members of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FAM</span></code> family in this case).

<span id="id4"></span><h3>12.3. Custom Trigger Functions<a class="headerlink" href="#custom-trigger-functions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Trigger functions are just normal Python functions, with a few special
properties:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>they must be defined in a module with the same name as the function</li>
<li>they can be located in:
- <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;cylc-dir&gt;/lib/cylc/xtriggers/</span></code>
- <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;suite-dir&gt;/lib/python/</span></code>
- (or anywhere in your Python library path)</li>
<li>they can take arbitrary positional and keyword arguments</li>
<li>suite and task identity, and cycle point, can be passed to trigger
functions by using string templates in function arguments (see below)</li>
<li>integer, float, boolean, and string arguments will be recognized and
passed to the function as such</li>
<li>if a trigger function depends on files or directories (for example)
that might not exist when the function is first called, just return
unsatisified until everything required does exist.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Trigger functions cannot store data Pythonically between invocations
because each call is executed in an independent process in the process
pool. If necessary the filesystem can be used for this purpose.</p>
</div>
<p>The following string templates are available for use, if the trigger function
needs any of this information, in function arguments in the suite configuration:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">%(name)s</span></code> - name of the dependent task</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">%(id)s</span></code> - identity of the dependent task (name.cycle-point)</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">%(point)s</span></code> - cycle point of the dependent task</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">%(debug)s</span></code> - suite debug mode</li>
</ul>
<p>and less commonly needed:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">%(user_name)s</span></code> - suite owner’s user name</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">%(suite_name)s</span></code> - registered suite name</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">%(suite_run_dir)s</span></code> - suite run directory</li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">%(suite_share_dir)s</span></code> - suite share directory</li>
</ul>
<p>Function return values should be as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>if the trigger condition is <em>not satisfied</em>:<ul>
<li>return <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(False,</span> <span class="pre">{})</span></code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>if the trigger condition is <em>satisfied</em>:<ul>
<li>return <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(True,</span> <span class="pre">results)</span></code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>where <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">results</span></code> is an arbitrary dictionary of information to be
passed to dependent tasks. How this looks to these tasks is described above
in <a class="reference internal" href="#built-in-suite-state-triggers"><span class="std std-ref">Built-in Suite State Triggers</span></a>.</p>
<p>The suite server program manages trigger functions as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>they are called asynchronously in the process pool
- (except for clock triggers, which are called from the main process)</li>
<li>they are called repeatedly on a configurable interval, until satisified
- the call interval defaults to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PT10S</span></code> (10 seconds)
- repeat calls are not made until the previous call has returned</li>
<li>they are subject to the normal process pool command time out - if they
take too long to return, the process will be killed</li>
<li>they are shared for efficiency: a single call will be made for all
triggers that share the same function signature - i.e.the same function
name and arguments</li>
<li>their return status and results are stored in the suite DB and persist across
suite restarts</li>
<li>their stdout, if any, is redirected to stderr and will be visible in
the suite log in debug mode (stdout is needed to communicate return values
from the sub-process in which the function executes)</li>
</ul>

<li>aside from the predefined zero-offset <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wall_clock</span></code> trigger, all
unique trigger function calls must be declared <em>with all of

referred to by label alone in the graph. It would be convenient (and less
verbose, although no more functional) if we could just declare a label
against the <em>common</em> arguments, and give remaining arguments (such as
different wall clock offsets in clock triggers) as needed in the graph.</li>

difficult to support as a plugin mechanism in Cylc, but we may decide to do it
in the future. In the meantime, consider implementing a small daemon process as
the watcher (e.g. to watch continuously for filesystem events) and have your
Cylc trigger functions interact with it.</p>

<span id="old-style-external-triggers"></span><h3>12.7. Old-Style External Triggers (Deprecated)<a class="headerlink" href="#old-style-external-triggers-deprecated" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">This mechanism is now technically deprecated by the newer external
trigger functions (<a class="reference internal" href="#external-triggers"><span class="std std-ref">External Triggers</span></a>). (However we don’t recommend
wholesale conversion to the new method yet, until its interface has
stabilized - see <a class="reference internal" href="#current-trigger-function-limitations"><span class="std std-ref">Current Limitations</span></a>.)</p>
</div>
<p>These old-style external triggers are hidden task prerequisites that must be
satisfied by using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">ext-trigger</span></code> client command to send an
associated pre-defined event message to the suite along with an ID string that
distinguishes one instance of the event from another (the name of the target
task and its current cycle point are not required). The event ID is just an
arbitrary string to Cylc, but it can be used to identify something associated
with the event to the suite - such as the filename of a new
externally-generated dataset. When the suite server program receives the event
notification it will trigger the next instance of any task waiting on that
trigger (whatever its cycle point) and then broadcast
(see <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#cylc-broadcast"><span class="std std-ref">Cylc Broadcast</span></a>) the event ID to the cycle point of the triggered
task as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$CYLC_EXT_TRIGGER_ID</span></code>. Downstream tasks with the same cycle
point therefore know the new event ID too and can use it, if they need to, to
identify the same new dataset. In this way a whole workflow can be associated
with each new dataset, and multiple datasets can be processed in parallel if
they happen to arrive in quick succession.</p>
<p>An externally-triggered task must register the event it waits on in the suite
scheduling section:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># suite &quot;sat-proc&quot;</span>
<span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then, each time a new dataset arrives the external detection system should
notify the suite like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ cylc ext-trigger sat-proc <span class="s2">&quot;new sat X data avail&quot;</span> passX12334a
</pre></div>

<p>where “sat-proc” is the suite name and “passX12334a” is the ID string for
the new event. The suite passphrase must be installed on triggering account.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Only one task in a suite can trigger off a particular external message.

<p>External triggers are not normally needed in date-time cycling suites driven
by real time data that comes in at regular intervals. In these cases a data
retrieval task can be clock-triggered (and have appropriate retry intervals) to
submit at the expected data arrival time, so little time is wasted in polling.
However, if the arrival time of the cycle-point-specific data is highly
variable, external triggering may be used with the cycle point embedded in the
message:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># suite &quot;data-proc&quot;</span>
<span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Once the variable-length waiting is finished, an external detection system
should notify the suite like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ cylc ext-trigger data-proc <span class="s2">&quot;data arrived for 20150126T00&quot;</span> passX12334a
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where “data-proc” is the suite name, the cycle point has replaced the
variable in the trigger string, and “passX12334a” is the ID string for
the new event. The suite passphrase must be installed on the triggering
account. In this case, the event will trigger for the second cycle point but
not the first because of the cycle-point matching.</p>

<span id="suitestartup"></span><h3>13.1. Suite Start-Up<a class="headerlink" href="#suite-start-up" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are three ways to start a suite running: <em>cold start</em> and <em>warm start</em>,
which start from scratch; and <em>restart</em>, which starts from a prior
suite state checkpoint. The only difference between cold starts and warm starts
is that warm starts start from a point beyond the suite initial cycle point.</p>
<p>Once a suite is up and running it is typically a restart that is needed most
often (but see also <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">reload</span></code>). <em>Be aware that cold and warm
starts wipe out prior suite state, so you can’t go back to a restart if you
decide you made a mistake.</em></p>
<div class="section" id="cold-start">
<span id="id1"></span><h4>13.1.1. Cold Start<a class="headerlink" href="#cold-start" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A cold start is the primary way to start a suite run from scratch:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ cylc run SUITE <span class="o">[</span>INITIAL_CYCLE_POINT<span class="o">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The initial cycle point may be specified on the command line or in the suite.rc
file. The scheduler starts by loading the first instance of each task at the
suite initial cycle point, or at the next valid point for the task.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="warm-start">
<span id="id2"></span><h4>13.1.2. Warm Start<a class="headerlink" href="#warm-start" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A warm start runs a suite from scratch like a cold start, but from the
beginning of a given cycle point that is beyond the suite initial cycle point.
This is generally inferior to a <em>restart</em> (which loads a previously
recorded suite state - see <a class="reference internal" href="#restartingsuites"><span class="std std-ref">Restart and Suite State Checkpoints</span></a>) because it may result in
some tasks rerunning. However, a warm start may be required if a restart is not
possible, e.g. because the suite run database was accidentally deleted. The
warm start cycle point must be given on the command line:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ cylc run --warm SUITE <span class="o">[</span>START_CYCLE_POINT<span class="o">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The original suite initial cycle point is preserved, but all tasks and
dependencies before the given warm start cycle point are ignored.</p>
<p>The scheduler starts by loading a first instance of each task at the warm
start cycle point, or at the next valid point for the task.
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">R1</span></code>-type tasks behave exactly the same as other tasks - if their
cycle point is at or later than the given start cycle point, they will run; if
not, they will be ignored.</p>

<p>At restart (see <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">restart</span> <span class="pre">--help</span></code>) a suite server program
initializes its task pool from a previously recorded checkpoint state. By
default the latest automatic checkpoint - which is updated with every task
state change - is loaded so that the suite can carry on exactly as it was just
before being shut down or killed.</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ cylc restart SUITE
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Tasks recorded in the “submitted” or “running” states are automatically polled
(see <a class="reference internal" href="#task-job-polling"><span class="std std-ref">Task Job Polling</span></a>) at start-up to determine what happened to

<div class="section" id="restart-from-latest-checkpoint">
<h5>13.1.3.1. Restart From Latest Checkpoint<a class="headerlink" href="#restart-from-latest-checkpoint" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>

<p>Suite server programs automatically update the “latest” checkpoint every time
a task changes state, and at every suite restart, but you can also take
checkpoints at other times. To tell a suite server program to checkpoint its
current state:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ cylc checkpoint SUITE-NAME CHECKPOINT-NAME

</div>
<p>For example, with checkpoints named “bob”, “alice”, and “breakfast”:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ cylc ls-checkpoints SUITE-NAME

<p>Task jobs need access to Cylc on the job host, primarily for task messaging,
but also to allow user-defined task scripting to run other Cylc commands.</p>
<p>Cylc should be installed on job hosts as on suite hosts, with different
releases installed side-by-side and invoked via the central Cylc
wrapper according to the value of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$CYLC_VERSION</span></code> - see
<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#installcylc"><span class="std std-ref">Installing Cylc</span></a>. Task job scripts set <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$CYLC_VERSION</span></code> to the
version of the parent suite server program, so that the right Cylc will
be invoked by jobs on the job host.</p>
<p>Access to the Cylc executable (preferably the central wrapper as just
described) for different job hosts can be configured using site and user
global configuration files (on the suite host). If the environment for running
the Cylc executable is only set up correctly in a login shell for a given host,
you can set <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[hosts][HOST]use</span> <span class="pre">login</span> <span class="pre">shell</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">True</span></code> for the relevant

is not in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$PATH</span></code>, then <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[hosts][HOST]cylc</span> <span class="pre">executable</span></code> can
be used to specify the direct path to the executable.</p>
<p>To customize the environment more generally for Cylc on jobs hosts,

<span id="id3"></span><h3>13.4. The Suite Contact File<a class="headerlink" href="#the-suite-contact-file" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>At start-up, suite server programs write a <em>suite contact file</em>
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$HOME/cylc-run/SUITE/.service/contact</span></code> that records suite host,
user, port number, process ID, Cylc version, and other information. Client

<div class="section" id="task-job-polling">
<span id="id4"></span><h3>13.5. Task Job Polling<a class="headerlink" href="#task-job-polling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>At any point after job submission task jobs can be <em>polled</em> to check that
their true state conforms to what is currently recorded by the suite server
program.  See <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">poll</span> <span class="pre">--help</span></code> for how to poll one or more tasks
manually, or right-click poll a task or family in GUI.</p>
<p>Polling may be necessary if, for example, a task job gets killed by the
untrappable SIGKILL signal (e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">kill</span> <span class="pre">-9</span> <span class="pre">PID</span></code>), or if a network
outage prevents task success or failure messages getting through, or if the
suite server program itself is down when tasks finish execution.</p>
<p>To poll a task job the suite server program interrogates the
batch system, and the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">job.status</span></code> file, on the job host. This
information is enough to determine the final task status even if the
job finished while the suite server program was down or unreachable on
the network.</p>
<div class="section" id="routine-polling">
<h4>13.5.1. Routine Polling<a class="headerlink" href="#routine-polling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Task jobs are automatically polled at certain times: once on job submission
timeout; several times on exceeding the job execution time limit; and at suite
restart any tasks recorded as active in the suite state checkpoint are polled
to find out what happened to them while the suite was down.</p>
<p>Finally, in necessary routine polling can be configured as a way to track job
status on job hosts that do not allow networking routing back to the suite host
for task messaging by HTTPS or ssh. See <a class="reference internal" href="#polling-to-track-job-status"><span class="std std-ref">Polling to Track Job Status</span></a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="tracking-task-state">
<span id="taskcomms"></span><h3>13.6. Tracking Task State<a class="headerlink" href="#tracking-task-state" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Cylc supports three ways of tracking task state on job hosts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>task-to-suite messaging via HTTPS</li>
<li>task-to-suite messaging via non-interactive ssh to the suite host,
then local HTTPS</li>
<li>regular polling by the suite server program</li>
</ul>
<p>These can be configured per job host in the Cylc global config file - see
<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#sitercreference"><span class="std std-ref">Global (Site, User) Config File Reference</span></a>.</p>
<p>If your site prohibits HTTPS and ssh back from job hosts to
suite hosts, before resorting to the polling method you should
consider installing dedicated Cylc servers or
VMs inside the HPC trust zone (where HTTPS and ssh should be allowed).</p>
<p>It is also possible to run Cylc suite server programs on HPC login
nodes, but this is not recommended for load, run duration,
and GUI reasons.</p>
<p>Finally, it has been suggested that <em>port forwarding</em> may provide another
solution - but that is beyond the scope of this document.</p>
<div class="section" id="https-task-messaging">
<h4>13.6.1. HTTPS Task Messaging<a class="headerlink" href="#https-task-messaging" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Task job wrappers automatically invoke <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">message</span></code> to report
progress back to the suite server program when they begin executing,
at normal exit (success) and abnormal exit (failure).</p>
<p>By default the messaging occurs via an authenticated, HTTPS connection to the
suite server program. This is the preferred task communications
method - it is efficient and direct.</p>
<p>Suite server programs automatically install suite contact information
and credentials on job hosts.  Users only need to do this manually
for remote access to suites on other hosts, or suites owned by other
users - see <a class="reference internal" href="#remotecontrol"><span class="std std-ref">Remote Control</span></a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="ssh-task-messaging">
<h4>13.6.2. Ssh Task Messaging<a class="headerlink" href="#ssh-task-messaging" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Cylc can be configured to re-invoke task messaging commands on the
suite host via non-interactive ssh (from job host to suite host).
Then a local HTTPS connection is made to the suite server program.</p>
<p>(User-invoked client commands (aside from the GUI, which requires HTTPS)
can do the same thing with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--use-ssh</span></code> command option).</p>
<p>This is less efficient than direct HTTPS messaging, but it may be useful at
sites where the HTTPS ports are blocked but non-interactive ssh is allowed.</p>

<span id="id5"></span><h4>13.6.3. Polling to Track Job Status<a class="headerlink" href="#polling-to-track-job-status" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Finally, suite server programs can actively poll task jobs at
configurable intervals, via non-interactive ssh to the job host.</p>
<p>Polling is the least efficient task communications method because task state is
updated only at intervals, not when task events actually occur.  However, it
may be needed at sites that do not allow HTTPS or non-interactive ssh from job
host to suite host.</p>
<p>Be careful to avoid spamming task hosts with polling commands. Each poll
opens (and then closes) a new ssh connection.</p>
<p>Polling intervals are configurable under <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[runtime]</span></code> because
they should may depend on the expected execution time. For instance, a
task that typically takes an hour to run might be polled every 10
minutes initially, and then every minute toward the end of its run.
Interval values are used in turn until the last value, which is used
repeatedly until finished:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[runtime]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[foo]]</span>
        <span class="nt">[[[job]]]</span>
            <span class="c1"># poll every minute in the &#39;submitted&#39; state:</span>
            <span class="nv">submission polling intervals </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> PT1M</span>
            <span class="c1"># poll one minute after foo starts running, then every 10</span>
            <span class="c1"># minutes for 50 minutes, then every minute until finished:</span>
            <span class="nv">execution polling intervals </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> PT1M, 5*PT10M, PT1M</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A list of intervals with optional multipliers can be used for both
submission and execution polling, although a single value is probably
sufficient for submission polling. If these items are not configured
default values from site and user global config will be used for the polling
task communication method; polling is not done by default under the
other task communications methods (but it can still be used if you
like).</p>

both hosts.</li>
<li><em>non-interactive ssh</em> from the client account to the server

<p>With a shared filesystem, a suite registered on the remote (server) host is
also - in effect - registered on the local (client) host.  In this case you
can invoke client commands without the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--host</span></code> option; the client
will automatically read the host and port from the contact file in the
suite service directory.</p>
<p>To control suite server programs running under other user accounts or on other

<h3>13.13. Task States Explained<a class="headerlink" href="#task-states-explained" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As a suite runs, its task proxies may pass through the following states:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>waiting</strong> - still waiting for prerequisites (e.g. dependence on
other tasks, and clock triggers) to be satisfied.</li>
<li><strong>held</strong> - will not be submitted to run even if all prerequisites
are satisfied, until released/un-held.</li>
<li><strong>queued</strong> - ready to run (prerequisites satisfied) but
temporarily held back by an <em>internal cylc queue</em>
(see <a class="reference internal" href="#internalqueues"><span class="std std-ref">Limiting Activity With Internal Queues</span></a>).</li>
<li><strong>ready</strong> - ready to run (prerequisites satisfied) and
handed to cylc’s job submission sub-system.</li>
<li><strong>submitted</strong> - submitted to run, but not executing yet
(could be waiting in an external batch scheduler queue).</li>
<li><strong>submit-failed</strong> - job submission failed <em>or</em>
submitted job killed (cancelled) before commencing execution.</li>
<li><strong>submit-retrying</strong> - job submission failed, but a submission retry
was configured. Will only enter the <em>submit-failed</em> state if all
configured submission retries are exhausted.</li>
<li><strong>running</strong> - currently executing (a <em>task started</em>
message was received, or the task polled as running).</li>
<li><strong>succeeded</strong> - finished executing successfully (a <em>task
succeeded</em> message was received, or the task polled as succeeded).</li>
<li><strong>failed</strong> - aborted execution due to some error condition (a
<em>task failed</em> message was received, or the task polled as failed).</li>
<li><strong>retrying</strong> - job execution failed, but an execution retry
was configured. Will only enter the <em>failed</em> state if all configured
execution retries are exhausted.</li>
<li><strong>runahead</strong> - will not have prerequisites checked (and so
automatically held, in effect) until the rest of the suite catches up
sufficiently.  The amount of runahead allowed is configurable - see
<a class="reference internal" href="#runaheadlimit"><span class="std std-ref">Runahead Limiting</span></a>.</li>
<li><strong>expired</strong> - will not be submitted to run, due to falling too far

<h3>13.14. What The Suite Control GUI Shows<a class="headerlink" href="#what-the-suite-control-gui-shows" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The GUI Text-tree and Dot Views display the state of every task proxy present
in the task pool. Once a task has succeeded and Cylc has determined that it can
no longer be needed to satisfy the prerequisites of other tasks, its proxy will
be cleaned up (removed from the pool) and it will disappear from the GUI. To
rerun a task that has disappeared from the pool, you need to re-insert its task
proxy and then re-trigger it.</p>
<p>The Graph View is slightly different: it displays the complete dependency graph
over the range of cycle points currently present in the task pool. This often
includes some greyed-out <em>base</em> or <em>ghost nodes</em> that are empty - i.e.
there are no corresponding task proxies currently present in the pool. Base
nodes just flesh out the graph structure. Groups of them may be cut out and
replaced by single <em>scissor nodes</em> in sections of the graph that are
currently inactive.</p>

<p>A connection timeout can be set in site and user global config files
(see <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#siteanduserconfiguration"><span class="std std-ref">Global (Site, User) Configuration Files</span></a>) so that messaging commands
cannot hang indefinitely if the suite is not responding (this can be
caused by suspending a suite with Ctrl-Z) thereby preventing the task
from completing. The same can be done on the command line for other
suite-connecting user commands, with the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--comms-timeout</span></code> option.</p>

<div class="section" id="runahead-limiting">
<span id="runaheadlimit"></span><h3>13.16. Runahead Limiting<a class="headerlink" href="#runahead-limiting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Runahead limiting prevents the fastest tasks in a suite from getting too far
ahead of the slowest ones. Newly spawned tasks are released to the task pool
only when they fall below the runahead limit. A low runhead limit can prevent
cylc from interleaving cycles, but it will not stall a suite unless it fails to
extend out past a future trigger (see <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#intercyclepointtriggers"><span class="std std-ref">Inter-Cycle Triggers</span></a>).
A high runahead limit may allow fast tasks that are not constrained by
dependencies or clock-triggers to spawn far ahead of the pack, which could have
performance implications for the suite server program when running very large
suites.  Succeeded and failed tasks are ignored when computing the runahead
limit.</p>
<p>The preferred runahead limiting mechanism restricts the number of consecutive
active cycle points. The default value is three active cycle points;
see <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#max-active-cycle-points"><span class="std std-ref">[scheduling] -&gt; max active cycle points</span></a>. Alternatively the interval between the
slowest and fastest tasks can be specified as hard limit;

<span id="internalqueues"></span><h3>13.17. Limiting Activity With Internal Queues<a class="headerlink" href="#limiting-activity-with-internal-queues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Large suites can potentially overwhelm task hosts by submitting too many
tasks at once. You can prevent this with <em>internal queues</em>, which
limit the number of tasks that can be active (submitted or running)
at the same time.</p>
<p>Internal queues behave in the first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner, i.e. tasks are
released from a queue in the same order that they were queued.</p>
<p>A queue is defined by a <em>name</em>; a <em>limit</em>, which is the maximum
number of active tasks allowed for the queue; and a list of <em>members</em>,
assigned by task or family name.</p>
<p>Queue configuration is done under the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[scheduling]</span></code> section of the suite.rc
file (like dependencies, internal queues constrain <em>when</em> a task runs).</p>
<p>By default every task is assigned to the <em>default</em> queue, which by default
has a zero limit (interpreted by cylc as no limit). To use a single queue for
the whole suite just set the default queue limit:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[ queues]]</span>
        <span class="c1"># limit the entire suite to 5 active tasks at once</span>
        <span class="nt">[[[default]]]</span>
            <span class="nv">limit </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> 5</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To use additional queues just name each one, set their limits, and assign
members:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[ queues]]</span>
        <span class="nt">[[[q_foo]]]</span>

            <span class="nv">members </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> foo, bar, baz</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Any tasks not assigned to a particular queue will remain in the default
queue. The <em>queues</em> example suite illustrates how queues work by
running two task trees side by side (as seen in the graph GUI) each
limited to 2 and 3 tasks respectively:</p>

<p>Tasks can be configured with a list of “retry delay” intervals, as
ISO 8601 durations. If the task job fails it will go into the <em>retrying</em>

<p>If a task with configured retries is <em>killed</em> (by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">kill</span></code> or

<p>Cylc can call nominated event handlers - to do whatever you like - when certain
suite or task events occur. This facilitates centralized alerting and automated
handling of critical events. Event handlers can be used to send a message, call
a pager, or whatever; they can even intervene in the operation of their own
suite using cylc commands.</p>
<p>To send an email, use the built-in setting <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[[[events]]]mail</span> <span class="pre">events</span></code>
to specify a list of events for which notifications should be sent. (The
name of a registered task output can also be used as an event name in
this case.) E.g. to send an email on (submission) failed and retry:</p>

<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[[[events]]]mail</span> <span class="pre">smtp</span></code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, a cylc suite will send you no more than one task event email every
5 minutes - this is to prevent your inbox from being flooded by emails should a
large group of tasks all fail at similar time.
See <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#task-event-mail-interval"><span class="std std-ref">[cylc] -&gt; task event mail interval</span></a> for details.</p>
<p>Event handlers can be located in the suite <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bin/</span></code> directory;
otherwise it is up to you to ensure their location is in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$PATH</span></code> (in
the shell in which the suite server program runs). They should require little
resource and return quickly - see <a class="reference internal" href="#managing-external-command-execution"><span class="std std-ref">Managing External Command Execution</span></a>.</p>
<p>Task event handlers can be specified using the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[[[events]]]&lt;event&gt;</span> <span class="pre">handler</span></code> settings, where
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;event&gt;</span></code> is one of:</p>

<li>‘submitted’ - the job submit command was successful</li>
<li>‘submission failed’ - the job submit command failed</li>
<li>‘submission timeout’ - task job submission timed out</li>
<li>‘submission retry’ - task job submission failed, but will retry after
a configured delay</li>
<li>‘started’ - the task reported commencement of execution</li>
<li>‘succeeded’ - the task reported successful completion</li>
<li>‘warning’ - the task reported a WARNING severity message</li>
<li>‘critical’ - the task reported a CRITICAL severity message</li>
<li>‘custom’ - the task reported a CUSTOM severity message</li>
<li>‘late’ - the task is never active and is late</li>
<li>‘failed’ - the task failed</li>
<li>‘retry’ - the task failed but will retry after a configured delay</li>
<li>‘execution timeout’ - task execution timed out</li>
</ul>
<p>The value of each setting should be a list of command lines or command line
templates (see below).</p>
<p>Alternatively you can use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[[[events]]]handlers</span></code> and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[[[events]]]handler</span> <span class="pre">events</span></code>, where the former is a list of command
lines or command line templates (see below) and the latter is a list of events
for which these commands should be invoked. (The name of a registered task
output can also be used as an event name in this case.)</p>
<p>Event handler arguments can be constructed from various templates
representing suite name; task ID, name, cycle point, message, and submit
number name; and any suite or task <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[meta]</span></code> item.

<p>You may want to be notified when certain tasks are running late in a real time
production system - i.e. when they have not triggered by <em>the usual time</em>.
Tasks of primary interest are not normally clock-triggered however, so their
trigger times are mostly a function of how the suite runs in its environment,
and even external factors such as contention with other suites <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id17" id="id10">[3]</a> .</p>
<p>But if your system is reasonably stable from one cycle to the next such that a
given task has consistently triggered by some interval beyond its cycle point,
you can configure Cylc to emit a <em>late event</em> if it has not triggered by
that time. For example, if a task <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">forecast</span></code> normally triggers by 30

<p>Job submission commands, event handlers, and job poll and kill commands, are
executed by the suite server program in a “pool” of asynchronous
subprocesses, in order to avoid holding the suite up. The process pool is
actively managed to limit it to a configurable size (<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#process-pool-size"><span class="std std-ref">process pool size</span></a>).
Custom event handlers should be light-weight and quick-running because they
will tie up a process pool member until they complete, and the suite will
appear to stall if the pool is saturated with long-running processes. Processes
are killed after a configurable timeout (<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#process-pool-timeout"><span class="std std-ref">process pool timeout</span></a>) however,
to guard against rogue commands that hang indefinitely. All process kills are
logged by the suite server program. For killed job submissions the associated
tasks also go to the <em>submit-failed</em> state.</p>

<span id="preemptionhpc"></span><h3>13.21. Handling Job Preemption<a class="headerlink" href="#handling-job-preemption" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Some HPC facilities allow job preemption: the resource manager can kill
or suspend running low priority jobs in order to make way for high
priority jobs. The preempted jobs may then be automatically restarted
by the resource manager, from the same point (if suspended) or requeued
to run again from the start (if killed).</p>
<p>Suspended jobs will poll as still running (their job status file says they
started running, and they still appear in the resource manager queue).
Loadleveler jobs that are preempted by kill-and-requeue (“job vacation”) are
automatically returned to the submitted state by Cylc.  This is possible
because Loadleveler sends the SIGUSR1 signal before SIGKILL for preemption.
Other batch schedulers just send SIGTERM before SIGKILL as normal, so Cylc
cannot distinguish a preemption job kill from a normal job kill. After this the
job will poll as failed (correctly, because it was killed, and the job status
file records that). To handle this kind of preemption automatically you could
use a task failed or retry event handler that queries the batch scheduler queue
(after an appropriate delay if necessary) and then, if the job has been
requeued, uses <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">reset</span></code> to reset the task to the submitted state.</p>

any other runtime settings) may be broadcast to all subsequent tasks,
or targeted specifically at a specific task, all subsequent tasks with a

<p>Broadcast settings targeted at a specific task ID or cycle point expire and
are forgotten as the suite moves on. Un-targeted variables and those

<p>Reference tests are finite-duration suite runs that abort with non-zero
exit status if any of the following conditions occur (by default):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>cylc fails</li>
<li>any task fails</li>
<li>the suite times out (e.g. a task dies without reporting failure)</li>
<li>a nominated shutdown event handler exits with error status</li>
</ul>
<p>The default shutdown event handler for reference tests is
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">hook</span> <span class="pre">check-triggering</span></code> which compares task triggering
information (what triggers off what at run time) in the test run suite
log to that from an earlier reference run, disregarding the timing and
order of events - which can vary according to the external queueing
conditions, runahead limit, and so on.</p>
<p>To prepare a reference log for a suite, run it with the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--reference-log</span></code> option, and manually verify the
correctness of the reference run.</p>
<p>To reference test a suite, just run it (in dummy mode for the most
comprehensive test without running real tasks) with the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">--reference-test</span></code> option.</p>
<p>A battery of automated reference tests is used to test cylc before
posting a new release version. Reference tests can also be used to check that
a cylc upgrade will not break your own complex
suites - the triggering check will catch any bug that causes a task to
run when it shouldn’t, for instance; even in a dummy mode reference
test the full task job script (sans <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">script</span></code> items) executes on the
proper task host by the proper batch system.</p>

the same cycling sequence as the remote-suite target task (as recommended

<p>If a suite run directory gets deleted or corrupted, the options for recovery
are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>restore the run directory from back-up, and restart the suite</li>
<li>re-install from source, and warm start from the beginning of the
current cycle point</li>
</ul>
<p>A warm start (see <a class="reference internal" href="#warm-start"><span class="std std-ref">Warm Start</span></a>) does not need a suite state
checkpoint, but it wipes out prior run history, and it could re-run
a significant number of tasks that had already completed.</p>
<p>To restart the suite, the critical Cylc files that must be restored are:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># On the suite host:</span>
~/cylc-run/SUITE-NAME/

</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">This discussion does not address restoration of files generated and
consumed by task jobs at run time. How suite data is stored and recovered
in your environment is a matter of suite and system design.</p>
</div>
<p>In short, you can simply restore the suite service directory, the log
directory, and the suite.rc file that is the target of the symlink in the
service directory. The service and log directories will come with extra files
that aren’t strictly needed for a restart, but that doesn’t matter - although
depending on your log housekeeping the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">log/job</span></code> directory could be
huge, so you might want to be selective about that.  (Also in a Rose suite, the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">suite.rc</span></code> file does not need to be restored if you restart with
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rose</span> <span class="pre">suite-run</span></code> - which re-installs suite source files to the run
directory).</p>
<p>The public DB is not strictly required for a restart - the suite server program
will recreate it if need be - but it is required by
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">ls-checkpoints</span></code> if you need to identify the right restart
checkpoint.</p>
<p>The job status files are only needed if the restart suite state checkpoint
contains active tasks that need to be polled to determine what happened to them
while the suite was down.  Without them, polling will fail and those tasks will
need to be manually set to the correct state.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">It is not safe to copy or rsync a potentially-active sqlite DB - the copy
might end up corrupted. It is best to stop the suite before copying

<div class="section" id="auto-stop-restart">
<span id="id16"></span><h3>13.31. Auto Stop-Restart<a class="headerlink" href="#auto-stop-restart" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Cylc has the ability to automatically stop suites running on a particular host
and optionally, restart them on a different host.
This is useful if a host needs to be taken off-line e.g. for
scheduled maintenance.</p>
<p>This functionality is configured via the following site configuration settings:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[run</span> <span class="pre">hosts][suite</span> <span class="pre">servers]auto</span> <span class="pre">restart</span> <span class="pre">delay</span></code></li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[run</span> <span class="pre">hosts][suite</span> <span class="pre">servers]condemned</span> <span class="pre">hosts</span></code></li>
<li><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[run</span> <span class="pre">hosts][suite</span> <span class="pre">servers]run</span> <span class="pre">hosts</span></code></li>
</ul>
<p>The auto stop-restart feature has two modes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>[Normal Mode]<ul>
<li>When a host is added to the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">condemned</span> <span class="pre">hosts</span></code> list, any suites
running on that host will automatically shutdown then restart selecting a
new host from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">run</span> <span class="pre">hosts</span></code>.</li>
<li>For safety, before attempting to stop the suite cylc will first wait
for any jobs running locally (under background or at) to complete.</li>
<li><em>In order for Cylc to be able to successfully restart suites the
``run hosts`` must all be on a shared filesystem.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[Force Mode]<ul>
<li>If a host is suffixed with an exclamation mark then Cylc will not attempt
to automatically restart the suite and any local jobs (running under
background or at) will be left running.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example in the following configuration any suites running on
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">foo</span></code> will attempt to restart on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pub</span></code> whereas any suites
running on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bar</span></code> will stop immediately, making no attempt to restart.</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[suite servers]</span>
    <span class="nv">run hosts </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> pub</span>
    <span class="nv">condemned hosts </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> foo, bar!</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To prevent large numbers of suites attempting to restart simultaneously the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">auto</span> <span class="pre">restart</span> <span class="pre">delay</span></code> setting defines a period of time in seconds.
Suites will wait for a random period of time between zero and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">auto</span> <span class="pre">restart</span> <span class="pre">delay</span></code> seconds before attempting to stop and restart.</p>
<p>At present the auto shutdown-restart functionality can only operate provided
that the user hasn’t specified any behaviour which is not preserved by
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">restart</span></code> (e.g. user specified hold point or run mode). This
caveat will be removed in a future version, currently Cylc will not attempt to
auto shutdown-restart suites which meet this criterion but will log a critical
error message to alert the user.</p>
<p>See the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[suite</span> <span class="pre">servers]</span></code> configuration section
(<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#global-suite-servers"><span class="std std-ref">[suite servers]</span></a>) for more details.</p>

<tbody valign="top">
<tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id10">[3]</a></td><td>Late notification of clock-triggered tasks is not very useful in
any case because they typically do not depend on other tasks, and as
such they can often trigger on time even if the suite is delayed to
the point that downstream tasks are late due to their dependence on
previous-cycle tasks that are delayed.</td></tr>

<p>Small groups of cylc users can of course share suites by manual copying,
and generic revision control tools can be used on cylc suites as for any
collection of files. Beyond this cylc does not have a built-in solution
for suite storage and discovery, revision control, and deployment, on a
network. That is not cylc’s core purpose, and large sites may have
preferred revision control systems and suite meta-data requirements that
are difficult to anticipate. We can, however, recommend the use of
<em>Rose</em> to do all of this very easily and elegantly with cylc suites.</p>

Clock-trigger tasks will trigger when the current UTC time is equal to
their cycle point date-time plus offset; other time values used, reported, or

<p>Cylc usually uses a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CCYYMMDDThhmmZ</span></code> (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Z</span></code> in the special
case of UTC) or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CCYYMMDDThhmm+hhmm</span></code> format (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">+</span></code> standing
for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">+</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">-</span></code> here) for writing down date-time cycle
points, which follows one of the basic formats outlined in the ISO 8601
standard. For example, a cycle point on the 3rd of February 2001 at 4:50 in
the morning, UTC (+0000 timezone), would be written
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">20010203T0450Z</span></code>. Similarly, for the 3rd of February 2001 at
4:50 in the morning, +1300 timezone, cylc would write
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">20010203T0450+1300</span></code>.</p>
<p>You may use the isodatetime library’s syntax to write dates and times in ISO
8601 formats - <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CC</span></code> for century, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">YY</span></code> for decade and
decadal year, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">+X</span></code> for expanded year digits and their positive or
negative sign, thereafter following the ISO 8601 standard example notation
except for fractional digits, which are represented as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">,ii</span></code> for
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">hh</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">,nn</span></code> for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mm</span></code>, etc. For example, to write
date-times as week dates with fractional hours, set cycle point format to
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CCYYWwwDThh,iiZ</span></code> e.g.  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1987W041T08,5Z</span></code> for 08:30 UTC on
Monday on the fourth ISO week of 1987.</p>
<p>You can also use a subset of the strptime/strftime POSIX standard - supported
tokens are <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">%F</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">%H</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">%M</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">%S</span></code>,

<p>The ISO8601 extended date-time format can be used
(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M</span></code>) but
note that the “-” and “:” characters end up in job log directory paths.</p>
<p>The pre cylc-6 legacy 10-digit date-time format YYYYMMDDHH is not ISO8601
compliant and can no longer be used as the cycle point format. For job
scripts that still require the old format, use the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">cyclepoint</span></code> utility to translate the ISO8601 cycle point
inside job scripts, e.g.:</p>

<p>The relative initial cycle point also works with truncated dates, including
weeks and ordinal date, using ISO8601 truncated date representations.
Note that day-of-week should always be specified when using weeks. If a time
is not included, the calculation of the next or previous corresponding
point will be done from midnight of the current day.

<p>Section containing metadata items for this task or family namespace.
Several items (title, description, URL) are pre-defined and are used by
the GUI. Others can be user-defined and passed to task event handlers to be
interpreted according to your needs. For example, the value of an
“importance” item could determine how an event handler responds to task
failure events.</p>
<p>Any suite meta item can now be passed to task event handlers by prefixing the
string template item name with “suite_”, for example:</p>

<p>Event handlers can be located in the suite <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bin/</span></code> directory,

will be substituted with actual values:</p>
<ul class="simple">

Task families are automatically node groups. Styling of a
family node applies to all member nodes (tasks and sub-families), but
precedence is determined by ordering in the suite configuration.  For
example, if you style a family red and then one of its members green,
cylc will plot a red family with one green member; but if you style one
member green and then the family red, the red family styling will
override the earlier green styling of the member.</p>

<p>The default task host is the suite host, <strong>localhost</strong>, with default
values as listed below. Use an explicit <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[hosts][[localhost]]</span></code>
section if you need to override the defaults. Localhost settings are
then also used as defaults for other hosts, with the local home
directory path replaced as described above. This applies to items
omitted from an explicit host section, and to hosts that are not listed
at all in the site and user config files.  Explicit host sections are only
needed if the automatically modified local defaults are not sufficient.</p>
<p>Host section headings can also be <em>regular expressions</em> to match
multiple hostnames.</p>
<div class="admonition note">

<p>Cylc can poll running jobs to catch problems that prevent task messages

outages, or unplanned task host shutdown. Routine polling is done only
for the polling <em>task communication method</em> (below) unless
suite-specific polling is configured in the suite configuration.
A list of interval values can be specified, with the last value used
repeatedly until the task is finished - this allows more frequent
polling near the beginning and end of the anticipated task run time.

frequency) to a maximum determined by this setting.</p>

<h3>15.5. Remote Job Management<a class="headerlink" href="#remote-job-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Managing tasks in a workflow requires more than just job execution: Cylc
performs additional actions with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rsync</span></code> for file transfer, and
direct execution of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span></code> sub-commands over non-interactive
SSH <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id5" id="id1">[4]</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="ssh-free-job-management">
<h4>15.5.1. SSH-free Job Management?<a class="headerlink" href="#ssh-free-job-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Some sites may want to restrict access to job hosts by whitelisting SSH
connections to allow only <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rsync</span></code> for file transfer, and allowing job
execution only via a local batch system that sees the job hosts <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id6" id="id2">[5]</a> .
We are investigating the feasibility of SSH-free job management when a local
batch system is available, but this is not yet possible unless your suite
and job hosts also share a filesystem, which allows Cylc to treat jobs as
entirely local <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id7" id="id3">[6]</a> .</p>

<div class="section" id="ssh-based-job-management">
<h4>15.5.2. SSH-based Job Management<a class="headerlink" href="#ssh-based-job-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Cylc does not have persistent agent processes running on job hosts to act on
instructions received over the network <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id8" id="id4">[7]</a> so instead we execute job
management commands directly on job hosts over SSH. Reasons for this include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>it works equally for batch system and background jobs</li>
<li>SSH is <em>required</em> for background jobs, and for batch jobs if the
batch system is not available on the suite host</li>
<li><em>querying the batch system alone is not sufficient for full job
polling functionality</em> because jobs can complete (and then be forgotten by
the batch system) while the network, suite host, or suite server program is
down (e.g. between suite shutdown and restart)<ul>
<li>to handle this we get the automatic job wrapper code to write
job messages and exit status to <em>job status files</em> that are
interrogated by suite server programs during job polling operations</li>
<li>job status files reside on the job host, so the interrogation
is done over SSH</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>job status files also hold batch system name and job ID; this is
written by the job submit command, and read by job poll and kill commands
(all over SSH)</li>

TASK IDENTIFICATION IN CYLC SUITES
  Tasks are identified by NAME.CYCLE_POINT where POINT is either a
  date-time or an integer.
  Date-time cycle points are in an ISO 8601 date-time format, typically
  CCYYMMDDThhmm followed by a time zone - e.g. 20101225T0600Z.
  Integer cycle points (including those for one-off suites) are integers
  - just &#39;1&#39; for one-off suites.

<div class="highlight-none notranslate" id="command-5to6"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   Usage: cylc [prep] 5to6 FILE

Suggest changes to a cylc 5 suite file to make it more cylc 6 compatible.
This may be a suite.rc file, an include file, or a suite.rc.processed file.

By default, print the changed file to stdout. Lines that have been changed
are marked with &#39;# UPGRADE&#39;. These marker comments are purely for your own
information and should not be included in any changes you make. In
particular, they may break continuation lines.

Lines with &#39;# UPGRADE CHANGE&#39; have been altered.
Lines with &#39;# UPGRADE ... INFO&#39; indicate that manual change is needed.

As of cylc 7, &#39;cylc validate&#39; will no longer print out automatic dependency
section translations. At cylc 6 versions of cylc, &#39;cylc validate&#39; will show
start-up/mixed async replacement R1* section(s). The validity of these can
be highly dependent on the initial cycle point choice (e.g. whether it is
T00 or T12).

This command works best for hour-based cycling - it will always convert
e.g. &#39;foo[T-6]&#39; to &#39;foo[-PT6H]&#39;, even where this is in a monthly or yearly
cycling section graph.

This command is an aid, and is not an auto-upgrader or a substitute for
reading the documentation. The suggested changes must be understood and
checked by hand.

Example usage:

# Print out a file path (FILE) with suggested changes to stdout.
cylc 5to6 FILE

# Replace the file with the suggested changes file.
cylc 5to6 FILE &gt; FILE

# Save a copy of the changed file.
cylc 5to6 FILE &gt; FILE.5to6

# Show the diff of the changed file vs the original file.
diff - &lt;(cylc 5to6 FILE) &lt;FILE

  -h, --help   Print this help message and exit.

<div class="section" id="broadcast">
<h5>15.6.3.2. broadcast<a class="headerlink" href="#broadcast" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate" id="command-broadcast"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   Usage: cylc [control] broadcast|bcast [OPTIONS] REG

Override [runtime] config in targeted namespaces in a running suite.

Uses for broadcast include making temporary changes to task behaviour,
and task-to-downstream-task communication via environment variables.

A broadcast can target any [runtime] namespace for all cycles or for a
specific cycle.  If a task is affected by specific-cycle and all-cycle
broadcasts at once, the specific takes precedence. If a task is affected
by broadcasts to multiple ancestor namespaces, the result is determined
by normal [runtime] inheritance. In other words, it follows this order:

all:root -&gt; all:FAM -&gt; all:task -&gt; tag:root -&gt; tag:FAM -&gt; tag:task

Broadcasts persist, even across suite restarts, until they expire when
their target cycle point is older than the oldest current in the suite,
or until they are explicitly cancelled with this command.  All-cycle
broadcasts do not expire.

For each task the final effect of all broadcasts to all namespaces is
computed on the fly just prior to job submission.  The --cancel and
--clear options simply cancel (remove) active broadcasts, they do not
act directly on the final task-level result. Consequently, for example,
you cannot broadcast to &quot;all cycles except Tn&quot; with an all-cycle
broadcast followed by a cancel to Tn (there is no direct broadcast to Tn
to cancel); and you cannot broadcast to &quot;all members of FAMILY except
member_n&quot; with a general broadcast to FAMILY followed by a cancel to
member_n (there is no direct broadcast to member_n to cancel).

To broadcast a variable to all tasks (quote items with internal spaces):
  % cylc broadcast -s &quot;[environment]VERSE = the quick brown fox&quot; REG
To do the same with a file:
  % cat &gt;&#39;broadcast.rc&#39; &lt;&lt;&#39;__RC__&#39;
  % [environment]
  %     VERSE = the quick brown fox
  % __RC__
  % cylc broadcast -F &#39;broadcast.rc&#39; REG
To cancel the same broadcast:
  % cylc broadcast --cancel &quot;[environment]VERSE&quot; REG
If -F FILE was used, the same file can be used to cancel the broadcast:
  % cylc broadcast -G &#39;broadcast.rc&#39; REG

Use -d/--display to see active broadcasts. Multiple --cancel options or
multiple --set and --set-file options can be used on the same command line.
Multiple --set and --set-file options are cumulative.

The --set-file=FILE option can be used when broadcasting multiple values, or
when the value contains newline or other metacharacters. If FILE is &quot;-&quot;, read
from standard input.

Broadcast cannot change [runtime] inheritance.

See also &#39;cylc reload&#39; - reload a modified suite definition at run time.

Arguments:
   REG               Suite name

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p CYCLE_POINT, --point=CYCLE_POINT
                        Target cycle point. More than one can be added.
                        Defaults to &#39;*&#39; with --set and --cancel, and nothing
                        with --clear.
  -n NAME, --namespace=NAME
                        Target namespace. Defaults to &#39;root&#39; with --set and
                        --cancel, and nothing with --clear.
  -s [SEC]ITEM=VALUE, --set=[SEC]ITEM=VALUE
                        A [runtime] config item and value to broadcast.
  -F FILE, --set-file=FILE, --file=FILE
                        File with config to broadcast. Can be used multiple
                        times.
  -c [SEC]ITEM, --cancel=[SEC]ITEM
                        An item-specific broadcast to cancel.
  -G FILE, --cancel-file=FILE
                        File with broadcasts to cancel. Can be used multiple
                        times.
  -C, --clear           Cancel all broadcasts, or with -p/--point,
                        -n/--namespace, cancel all broadcasts to targeted
                        namespaces and/or cycle points. Use &quot;-C -p &#39;*&#39;&quot; to
                        cancel all all-cycle broadcasts without canceling all
                        specific-cycle broadcasts.
  -e CYCLE_POINT, --expire=CYCLE_POINT
                        Cancel any broadcasts that target cycle points earlier
                        than, but not inclusive of, CYCLE_POINT.
  -d, --display         Display active broadcasts.
  -k TASKID, --display-task=TASKID
                        Print active broadcasts for a given task
                        (NAME.CYCLE_POINT).
  -b, --box             Use unicode box characters with -d, -k.
  -r, --raw             With -d/--display or -k/--display-task, write out the
                        broadcast config structure in raw Python form.
  --user=USER           Other user account name. This results in command
                        reinvocation on the remote account.
  --host=HOST           Other host name. This results in command reinvocation
                        on the remote account.
  -v, --verbose         Verbose output mode.
  --debug               Output developer information and show exception
                        tracebacks.
  --port=INT            Suite port number on the suite host. NOTE: this is
                        retrieved automatically if non-interactive ssh is
                        configured to the suite host.
  --use-ssh             Use ssh to re-invoke the command on the suite host.
  --ssh-cylc=SSH_CYLC   Location of cylc executable on remote ssh commands.
  --no-login            Do not use a login shell to run remote ssh commands.
                        The default is to use a login shell.
  --comms-timeout=SEC, --pyro-timeout=SEC
                        Set a timeout for network connections to the running
                        suite. The default is no timeout. For task messaging
                        connections see site/user config file documentation.
  --print-uuid          Print the client UUID to stderr. This can be matched
                        to information logged by the receiving suite server
                        program.
  --set-uuid=UUID       Set the client UUID manually (e.g. from prior use of
                        --print-uuid). This can be used to log multiple
                        commands under the same UUID (but note that only the
                        first [info] command from the same client ID will be
                        logged unless the suite is running in debug mode).
  -f, --force           Do not ask for confirmation before acting. Note that
                        it is not necessary to use this option if interactive
                        command prompts have been disabled in the site/user
                        config files.

<div class="highlight-none notranslate" id="command-cat-log"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   Usage: cylc [info] cat-log|log [OPTIONS] REG [TASK-ID]

Print, view-in-editor, or tail-follow content, print path, or list directory,
of local or remote task job and suite server logs. Batch-system view commands
(e.g. &#39;qcat&#39;) are used if defined in global config and the job is running.

For standard log types use the short-cut option argument or full filename (e.g.
for job stdout &quot;-f o&quot; or &quot;-f job.out&quot; will do).

To list the local job log directory of a remote task, choose &quot;-m l&quot; (directory
list mode) and a local file, e.g. &quot;-f a&quot; (job-activity.log).

If remote job logs are retrieved to the suite host on completion (global config
&#39;[JOB-HOST]retrieve job logs = True&#39;) and the job is not currently running, the
local (retrieved) log will be accessed unless &#39;-o/--force-remote&#39; is used.

Custom job logs (written to $CYLC_TASK_LOG_DIR on the job host) are available
from the GUI if listed in &#39;extra log files&#39; in the suite definition. The file
name must be given here, but can be discovered with &#39;--mode=l&#39; (list-dir).

The correct cycle point format of the suite must be for task job logs.

Note the --host/user options are not needed to view remote job logs. They are
the general command reinvocation options for sites using ssh-based task
messaging.

Arguments:
   REG                     Suite name
   [TASK-ID]               Task ID

<div class="highlight-none notranslate" id="command-check-triggering"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   cylc [hook] check-triggering ARGS

This is a cylc shutdown event handler that compares the newly generated
suite log with a previously generated reference log &quot;reference.log&quot;
stored in the suite definition directory. Currently it just compares
runtime triggering information, disregarding event order and timing, and
fails the suite if there is any difference. This should be sufficient to
verify correct scheduling of any suite that is not affected by different
run-to-run conditional triggering.

1) run your suite with &quot;cylc run --generate-reference-log&quot; to generate
the reference log with resolved triggering information. Check manually
that the reference run was correct.
2) run reference tests with &quot;cylc run --reference-test&quot; - this
automatically sets the shutdown event handler along with a suite timeout
and &quot;abort if shutdown handler fails&quot;, &quot;abort on timeout&quot;, and &quot;abort if
any task fails&quot;.

Reference tests can use any run mode:
 * simulation mode - tests that scheduling is equivalent to the reference
 * dummy mode - also tests that task hosting, job submission, job script
   evaluation, and cylc messaging are not broken.
 * live mode - tests everything (but takes longer with real tasks!)

 If any task fails, or if cylc itself fails, or if triggering is not
 equivalent to the reference run, the test will abort with non-zero exit
 status - so reference tests can be used as automated tests to check
 that changes to cylc have not broken your suites.

<div class="highlight-none notranslate" id="command-check-versions"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   Usage: cylc [discovery] check-versions [OPTIONS] SUITE

Check the version of cylc invoked on each of SUITE&#39;s task host accounts when
CYLC_VERSION is set to *the version running this command line tool*.
Different versions are reported but are not considered an error unless the
-e|--error option is specified, because different cylc versions from 6.0.0
onward should at least be backward compatible.

It is recommended that cylc versions be installed in parallel and access
configured via the cylc version wrapper as described in the cylc INSTALL
file and User Guide. This must be done on suite and task hosts. Users then get
the latest installed version by default, or (like tasks) a particular version
if $CYLC_VERSION is defined.

Use -v/--verbose to see the command invoked to determine the remote version
(all remote cylc command invocations will be of the same form, which may be
site dependent -- see cylc global config documentation.

  foo-2010-08-08-T00.nc

Other examples:

1) print offset from an explicit cycle point:
  % cylc [util] cycle-point --offset-hours=6 20100823T1800Z
  20100824T0000Z

2) print offset from $CYLC_TASK_CYCLE_POINT (as in suite tasks):
  % export CYLC_TASK_CYCLE_POINT=20100823T1800Z
  % cylc cycle-point --offset-hours=-6
  20100823T1200Z

3) cycle point filename templating, explicit template:
  % export CYLC_TASK_CYCLE_POINT=2010-08
  % cylc cycle-point --offset-years=2 --template=foo-CCYY-MM.nc
  foo-2012-08.nc

4) cycle point filename templating, template in a variable:

<div class="highlight-none notranslate" id="command-dump"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   Usage: cylc [info] dump [OPTIONS] REG

Print state information (e.g. the state of each task) from a running
suite. For small suites &#39;watch cylc [info] dump SUITE&#39; is an effective
non-GUI real time monitor (but see also &#39;cylc monitor&#39;).

For more information about a specific task, such as the current state of
its prerequisites and outputs, see &#39;cylc [info] show&#39;.

Examples:
 Display the state of all running tasks, sorted by cycle point:
 % cylc [info] dump --tasks --sort SUITE | grep running

 Display the state of all tasks in a particular cycle point:
 % cylc [info] dump -t SUITE | grep 2010082406

Arguments:

  --debug               Output developer information and show exception
                        tracebacks.
  --port=INT            Suite port number on the suite host. NOTE: this is
                        retrieved automatically if non-interactive ssh is
                        configured to the suite host.
  --use-ssh             Use ssh to re-invoke the command on the suite host.
  --ssh-cylc=SSH_CYLC   Location of cylc executable on remote ssh commands.
  --no-login            Do not use a login shell to run remote ssh commands.
                        The default is to use a login shell.
  --comms-timeout=SEC, --pyro-timeout=SEC
                        Set a timeout for network connections to the running

<div class="highlight-none notranslate" id="command-edit"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   Usage: cylc [prep] edit [OPTIONS] SUITE

Edit suite definitions without having to move to their directory
locations, and with optional reversible inlining of include-files. Note
that Jinja2 suites can only be edited in raw form but the processed
version can be viewed with &#39;cylc [prep] view -p&#39;.

1/cylc [prep] edit SUITE
Change to the suite definition directory and edit the suite.rc file.

2/ cylc [prep] edit -i,--inline SUITE
Edit the suite with include-files inlined between special markers. The
original suite.rc file is temporarily replaced so that the inlined
version is &quot;live&quot; during editing (i.e. you can run suites during
editing and cylc will pick up changes to the suite definition). The
inlined file is then split into its constituent include-files
again when you exit the editor. Include-files can be nested or
multiply-included; in the latter case only the first inclusion is
inlined (this prevents conflicting changes made to the same file).

3/ cylc [prep] edit --cleanup SUITE
Remove backup files left by previous INLINED edit sessions.

INLINED EDITING SAFETY: The suite.rc file and its include-files are
automatically backed up prior to an inlined editing session. If the
editor dies mid-session just invoke &#39;cylc edit -i&#39; again to recover from
the last saved inlined file. On exiting the editor, if any of the
original include-files are found to have changed due to external
intervention during editing you will be warned and the affected files
will be written to new backups instead of overwriting the originals.
Finally, the inlined suite.rc file is also backed up on exiting
the editor, to allow recovery in case of accidental corruption of the
include-file boundary markers in the inlined file.

The edit process is spawned in the foreground as follows:
  % &lt;editor&gt; suite.rc
Where &lt;editor&gt; is defined in the cylc site/user config files.

See also &#39;cylc [prep] view&#39;.

Arguments:
   SUITE               Suite name or path

Options:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  -i, --inline         Edit with include-files inlined as described above.
  --cleanup            Remove backup files left by previous inlined edit
                       sessions.
  -g, --gui            Force use of the configured GUI editor.
  --user=USER          Other user account name. This results in command
                       reinvocation on the remote account.
  --host=HOST          Other host name. This results in command reinvocation
                       on the remote account.
  -v, --verbose        Verbose output mode.
  --debug              Output developer information and show exception
                       tracebacks.

<div class="highlight-none notranslate" id="command-ext-trigger"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   Usage: cylc [control] ext-trigger [OPTIONS] REG MSG ID

Report an external event message to a suite server program. It is expected that
a task in the suite has registered the same message as an external trigger - a
special prerequisite to be satisifed by an external system, via this command,
rather than by triggering off other tasks.

The ID argument should uniquely distinguish one external trigger event from the
next. When a task&#39;s external trigger is satisfied by an incoming message, the
message ID is broadcast to all downstream tasks in the cycle point as
$CYLC_EXT_TRIGGER_ID so that they can use it - e.g. to identify a new data file
that the external triggering system is responding to.

Use the retry options in case the target suite is down or out of contact.

The suite passphrase must be installed in $HOME/.cylc/&lt;SUITE&gt;/.

Note: to manually trigger a task use &#39;cylc trigger&#39;, not this command.

Arguments:
   REG               Suite name

     Plot the specified dot-language graph file.
       3/ cylc [prep] graph [OPTIONS] --reference SUITE [START[STOP]]
     Print out a reference format for the dependencies in SUITE.
       4/ cylc [prep] graph [OPTIONS] --output-file FILE SUITE
     Plot SUITE dependencies to a file FILE with a extension-derived format.
     If FILE endswith &quot;.png&quot;, output in PNG format, etc.

Plot suite dependency graphs in an interactive graph viewer.

If START is given it overrides &quot;[visualization] initial cycle point&quot; to
determine the start point of the graph, which defaults to the suite initial
cycle point. If STOP is given it overrides &quot;[visualization] final cycle point&quot;
to determine the end point of the graph, which defaults to the graph start
point plus &quot;[visualization] number of cycle points&quot; (which defaults to 3).
The graph start and end points are adjusted up and down to the suite initial
and final cycle points, respectively, if necessary.

The &quot;Save&quot; button generates an image of the current view, of format (e.g. png,
svg, jpg, eps) determined by the filename extension. If the chosen format is
not available a dialog box will show those that are available.

If the optional output filename is specified, the viewer will not open and a
graph will be written directly to the file.

GRAPH VIEWER CONTROLS:
    * Center on a node: left-click.
    * Pan view: left-drag.
    * Zoom: +/- buttons, mouse-wheel, or ctrl-left-drag.

<div class="highlight-none notranslate" id="command-insert"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   Usage: cylc [control] insert [OPTIONS] REG TASKID [...]

Insert task proxies into a running suite. Uses of insertion include:
 1) insert a task that was excluded by the suite definition at start-up.
 2) reinstate a task that was previously removed from a running suite.
 3) re-run an old task that cannot be retriggered because its task proxy
 is no longer live in the a suite.

Be aware that inserted cycling tasks keep on cycling as normal, even if
another instance of the same task exists at a later cycle (instances of
the same task at different cycles can coexist, but a newly spawned task
will not be added to the pool if it catches up to another task with the
same ID).

See also &#39;cylc submit&#39;, for running tasks without the scheduler.

TASKID is a pattern to match task proxies or task families, or groups of them:
* [CYCLE-POINT-GLOB/]TASK-NAME-GLOB[:TASK-STATE]
* [CYCLE-POINT-GLOB/]FAMILY-NAME-GLOB[:TASK-STATE]
* TASK-NAME-GLOB[.CYCLE-POINT-GLOB][:TASK-STATE]
* FAMILY-NAME-GLOB[.CYCLE-POINT-GLOB][:TASK-STATE]

For example, to match:
* all tasks in a cycle: &#39;20200202T0000Z/*&#39; or &#39;*.20200202T0000Z&#39;
* all tasks in the submitted status: &#39;:submitted&#39;
* retrying &#39;foo*&#39; tasks in 0000Z cycles: &#39;foo*.*0000Z:retrying&#39; or
  &#39;*0000Z/foo*:retrying&#39;
* retrying tasks in &#39;BAR&#39; family: &#39;*/BAR:retrying&#39; or &#39;BAR.*:retrying&#39;
* retrying tasks in &#39;BAR&#39; or &#39;BAZ&#39; families: &#39;*/BA[RZ]:retrying&#39; or
  &#39;BA[RZ].*:retrying&#39;

The old &#39;MATCH POINT&#39; syntax will be automatically detected and supported. To
avoid this, use the &#39;--no-multitask-compat&#39; option, or use the new syntax
(with a &#39;/&#39; or a &#39;.&#39;) when specifying 2 TASKID arguments.

<div class="highlight-none notranslate" id="command-message"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   Usage: cylc [task] message [OPTIONS] -- [REG] [TASK-JOB] [[SEVERITY:]MESSAGE ...]

Record task job messages.

Send task job messages to:
- The job stdout/stderr.
- The job status file, if there is one.
- The suite server program, if communication is possible.

Task jobs use this command to record and report status such as success and
failure. Applications run by task jobs can use this command to report messages
and to report registered task outputs.

Messages can be specified as arguments. A &#39;-&#39; indicates that the command should
read messages from STDIN. When reading from STDIN, multiple messages are
separated by empty lines. Examples:

Single message as an argument:
 % cylc message -- &quot;${CYLC_SUITE_NAME}&quot; &quot;${CYLC_TASK_JOB}&quot; &#39;Hello world!&#39;

Multiple messages as arguments:
 % cylc message -- &quot;${CYLC_SUITE_NAME}&quot; &quot;${CYLC_TASK_JOB}&quot; \
        &#39;Hello world!&#39; &#39;Hi&#39; &#39;WARNING:Hey!&#39;

Multiple messages on STDIN:
 % cylc message -- &quot;${CYLC_SUITE_NAME}&quot; &quot;${CYLC_TASK_JOB}&quot; - &lt;&lt;&#39;__STDIN__&#39;
 % Hello
 % world!
 %
 % Hi
 %
 % WARNING:Hey!
 %__STDIN__

Note &quot;${CYLC_SUITE_NAME}&quot; and &quot;${CYLC_TASK_JOB}&quot; are made available in task job
environments - you do not need to write their actual values in task scripting.

Each message can be prefixed with a severity level using the syntax &#39;SEVERITY:
MESSAGE&#39;.

The default message severity is INFO. The --severity=SEVERITY option can be
used to set the default severity level for all unprefixed messages.

Note: to abort a job script with a custom error message, use cylc__job_abort:
  cylc__job_abort &#39;message...&#39;
(For technical reasons this is a shell function, not a cylc sub-command.)

For backward compatibility, if number of arguments is less than or equal to 2,
the command assumes the classic interface, where all arguments are messages.
Otherwise, the first 2 arguments are assumed to be the suite name and the task
job identifier.


Arguments:
   [REG]                                  Suite name

  --set-uuid=UUID       Set the client UUID manually (e.g. from prior use of
                        --print-uuid). This can be used to log multiple
                        commands under the same UUID (but note that only the
                        first [info] command from the same client ID will be
                        logged unless the suite is running in debug mode).

Poll (query) task jobs to verify and update their statuses.

Use &quot;cylc poll REG&quot; to poll all active tasks, or &quot;cylc poll REG TASKID&quot; to poll
individual tasks or families, or groups of them.

TASKID is a pattern to match task proxies or task families, or groups of them:
* [CYCLE-POINT-GLOB/]TASK-NAME-GLOB[:TASK-STATE]
* [CYCLE-POINT-GLOB/]FAMILY-NAME-GLOB[:TASK-STATE]
* TASK-NAME-GLOB[.CYCLE-POINT-GLOB][:TASK-STATE]
* FAMILY-NAME-GLOB[.CYCLE-POINT-GLOB][:TASK-STATE]

For example, to match:
* all tasks in a cycle: &#39;20200202T0000Z/*&#39; or &#39;*.20200202T0000Z&#39;
* all tasks in the submitted status: &#39;:submitted&#39;

<div class="highlight-none notranslate" id="command-profile-battery"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   Usage: cylc profile-battery [-e [EXPERIMENT ...]] [-v [VERSION ...]]

Run profiling experiments against different versions of cylc. A list of
experiments can be specified after the -e flag, if not provided the experiment
&quot;complex&quot; will be chosen. A list of versions to profile against can be
specified after the -v flag, if not provided the current version will be used.

Experiments are stored in etc/profile-experiments, user experiments can be
stored in .profiling/experiments. Experiments are specified without the file
extension, experiments in .profiling/ will be chosen before those in etc/.

IMPORTANT: See etc/profile-experiments/example for an experiment template with
further details.

Versions are any valid git identifiers i.e. tags, branches, commits. To compare
results to different cylc versions either:
    * Supply cylc profile-battery with a complete list of the versions you wish
      to profile, it will then provide the option to checkout the required
      versions automatically.
    * Checkout each version manually running cylc profile-battery against only
      one version at a time. Once all results have been gathered you can then
      run cylc profile-battery with a complete list of versions.

Profiling will save results to .profiling/results.json where they can be used
for future comparisons. To list profiling results run:
    * cylc profile-battery --ls  # list all results
    * cylc profile-battery --ls -e experiment  # list all results for
                                               # experiment &quot;experiment&quot;.
    * cylc profile-battery --ls --delete -v  6.1.2  # Delete all results for
                                                    # version 6.1.2 (prompted).

If matplotlib and numpy are installed profiling generates plots which are
saved to .profiling/plots or presented in an interactive window using the -i
flag.

Results are stored along with a checksum for the experiment file. When an
experiment file is changed previous results are maintained, future results will
be stored separately. To copy results from an older version of an experiment
into those from the current one run:
    * cylc profile-battery --promote experiment@checksum
NOTE: At present results cannot be analysed without the experiment file so old
results must be &quot;copied&quot; in this way to be re-used.

The results output contain only a small number of metrics, to see a full list
of results use the --full option.

<div class="highlight-none notranslate" id="command-register"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   Usage: cylc [prep] register [OPTIONS] [REG] [PATH]

Register the name REG for the suite definition in PATH. The suite server
program can then be started, stopped, and targeted by name REG. (Note that
&quot;cylc run&quot; can also register suites on the fly).

Registration creates a suite run directory &quot;~/cylc-run/REG/&quot; containing a
&quot;.service/source&quot; symlink to the suite definition PATH. The .service directory
will also be used for server authentication files at run time.

Suite names can be hierarchical, corresponding to the path under ~/cylc-run.

  % cylc register dogs/fido PATH
Register PATH/suite.rc as dogs/fido, with run directory ~/cylc-run/dogs/fido.

  % cylc register dogs/fido
Register $PWD/suite.rc as dogs/fido.

  % cylc register
Register $PWD/suite.rc as the parent directory name: $(basename $PWD).

The same suite can be registered with multiple names; this results in multiple
suite run directories that link to the same suite definition.

To &quot;unregister&quot; a suite, delete or rename its run directory (renaming it under
~/cylc-run effectively re-registers the original suite with the new name).

Use of &quot;--redirect&quot; is required to allow an existing name (and run directory)
to be associated with a different suite definition. This is potentially
dangerous because the new suite will overwrite files in the existing run
directory. You should consider deleting or renaming an existing run directory
rather than just re-use it with another suite.

Arguments:
   [REG]                Suite name
   [PATH]               Suite definition directory (defaults to $PWD)

Options:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  --redirect     Allow an existing suite name and run directory to be used
                 with another suite.

<div class="highlight-none notranslate" id="command-release"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   Usage: cylc [control] release|unhold [OPTIONS] REG [TASKID ...]

Release one or more held tasks (cylc release REG TASKID)
or the whole suite (cylc release REG). Held tasks do not
submit even if they are ready to run.

See also &#39;cylc [control] hold&#39;.

TASKID is a pattern to match task proxies or task families, or groups of them:

<div class="highlight-none notranslate" id="command-reload"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   Usage: cylc [control] reload [OPTIONS] REG

Tell a suite to reload its definition at run time. All settings
including task definitions, with the exception of suite log
configuration, can be changed on reload. Note that defined tasks can be
be added to or removed from a running suite with the &#39;cylc insert&#39; and
&#39;cylc remove&#39; commands, without reloading. This command also allows
addition and removal of actual task definitions, and therefore insertion
of tasks that were not defined at all when the suite started (you will
still need to manually insert a particular instance of a newly defined
task). Live task proxies that are orphaned by a reload (i.e. their task
definitions have been removed) will be removed from the task pool if
they have not started running yet. Changes to task definitions take
effect immediately, unless a task is already running at reload time.

If the suite was started with Jinja2 template variables set on the
command line (cylc run --set FOO=bar REG) the same template settings
apply to the reload (only changes to the suite.rc file itself are
reloaded).

If the modified suite definition does not parse, failure to reload will
be reported but no harm will be done to the running suite.

<div class="highlight-none notranslate" id="command-report-timings"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   Usage: cylc [util] report-timings [OPTIONS] REG

Retrieve suite timing information for wait and run time performance analysis.
Raw output and summary output (in text or HTML format) are available.  Output
is sent to standard output, unless an output filename is supplied.

Summary Output (the default):
Data stratified by host and batch system that provides a statistical
summary of
    1. Queue wait time (duration between task submission and start times)
    2. Task run time (duration between start and succeed times)
    3. Total run time (duration between task submission and succeed times)
Summary tables can be output in plain text format, or HTML with embedded SVG
boxplots.  Both summary options require the Pandas library, and the HTML
summary option requires the Matplotlib library.

Raw Output:
A flat list of tabular data that provides (for each task and cycle) the
    1. Time of successful submission
    2. Time of task start
    3. Time of task successful completion
as well as information about the batch system and remote host to permit
stratification/grouping if desired by downstream processors.

Timings are shown only for succeeded tasks.

For long-running and/or large suites (i.e. for suites with many task events),
the database query to obtain the timing information may take some time.

<div class="highlight-none notranslate" id="command-reset"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   Usage: cylc [control] reset [OPTIONS] REG [TASKID ...]

Force tasks to a specified state, and modify their prerequisites and outputs
accordingly.

Outputs are automatically updated to reflect the new task state, except for
custom message outputs - which can be manipulated directly with &quot;--output&quot;.

Prerequisites reflect the state of other  tasks; they are not changed except
to unset them on resetting the task state to &#39;waiting&#39; or earlier.

To hold and release tasks use &quot;cylc hold&quot; and &quot;cylc release&quot;.
&quot;cylc reset --state=spawn&quot; is deprecated: use &quot;cylc spawn&quot; instead.


TASKID is a pattern to match task proxies or task families, or groups of them:
* [CYCLE-POINT-GLOB/]TASK-NAME-GLOB[:TASK-STATE]
* [CYCLE-POINT-GLOB/]FAMILY-NAME-GLOB[:TASK-STATE]
* TASK-NAME-GLOB[.CYCLE-POINT-GLOB][:TASK-STATE]
* FAMILY-NAME-GLOB[.CYCLE-POINT-GLOB][:TASK-STATE]

For example, to match:
* all tasks in a cycle: &#39;20200202T0000Z/*&#39; or &#39;*.20200202T0000Z&#39;
* all tasks in the submitted status: &#39;:submitted&#39;
* retrying &#39;foo*&#39; tasks in 0000Z cycles: &#39;foo*.*0000Z:retrying&#39; or
  &#39;*0000Z/foo*:retrying&#39;
* retrying tasks in &#39;BAR&#39; family: &#39;*/BAR:retrying&#39; or &#39;BAR.*:retrying&#39;
* retrying tasks in &#39;BAR&#39; or &#39;BAZ&#39; families: &#39;*/BA[RZ]:retrying&#39; or
  &#39;BA[RZ].*:retrying&#39;

The old &#39;MATCH POINT&#39; syntax will be automatically detected and supported. To
avoid this, use the &#39;--no-multitask-compat&#39; option, or use the new syntax
(with a &#39;/&#39; or a &#39;.&#39;) when specifying 2 TASKID arguments.

                        Set a timeout for network connections to the running
                        suite. The default is no timeout. For task messaging
                        connections see site/user config file documentation.
  --print-uuid          Print the client UUID to stderr. This can be matched
                        to information logged by the receiving suite server
                        program.
  --set-uuid=UUID       Set the client UUID manually (e.g. from prior use of
                        --print-uuid). This can be used to log multiple
                        commands under the same UUID (but note that only the
                        first [info] command from the same client ID will be
                        logged unless the suite is running in debug mode).

Print information about running suites.

By default, it will obtain a listing of running suites for the current user
from the file system, before connecting to the suites to obtain information.
Use the -o/--suite-owner option to get information of running suites for other
users.

If a list of HOSTS is specified, it will obtain a listing of running suites by
scanning all ports in the relevant range for running suites on the specified
hosts. If the -a/--all option is specified, it will use the global
configuration &quot;[suite servers]scan hosts&quot; setting to determine a list of hosts
to scan.

Suite passphrases are not needed to get identity information (name and owner).
Titles, descriptions, state totals, and cycle point state totals may also be
revealed publicly, depending on global and suite authentication settings. Suite
passphrases still grant full access regardless of what is revealed publicly.

WARNING: a suite suspended with Ctrl-Z will cause port scans to hang until the

<div class="highlight-none notranslate" id="command-scp-transfer"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   Usage: cylc [util] scp-transfer [OPTIONS]

An scp wrapper for transferring a list of files and/or directories
at once. The source and target scp URLs can be local or remote (scp
can transfer files between two remote hosts). Passwordless ssh must
be configured appropriately.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE INPUTS:
$SRCE  - list of sources (files or directories) as scp URLs.
$DEST  - parallel list of targets as scp URLs.
The source and destination lists should be space-separated.

We let scp determine the validity of source and target URLs.
Target directories are created pre-copy if they don&#39;t exist.

Options:
 -v     - verbose: print scp stdout.
 --help - print this usage message.

Search for pattern matches in suite definitions and any files in the
suite bin directory. Matches are reported by line number and suite

pattern. Note that the order of command line arguments conforms to
normal cylc command usage (suite name first) not that of the grep
command.

Note that this command performs a text search on the suite definition,
it does not search the data structure that results from parsing the
suite definition - so it will not report implicit default settings.

<div class="highlight-none notranslate" id="command-stop"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   Usage: cylc [control] stop|shutdown [OPTIONS] REG [STOP]

Tell a suite server program to shut down. In order to prevent failures going
unnoticed, suites only shut down automatically at a final cycle point if no
failed tasks are present. There are several shutdown methods:

  1. (default) stop after current active tasks finish
  2. (--now) stop immediately, orphaning current active tasks
  3. (--kill) stop after killing current active tasks
  4. (with STOP as a cycle point) stop after cycle point STOP
  5. (with STOP as a task ID) stop after task ID STOP has succeeded
  6. (--wall-clock=T) stop after time T (an ISO 8601 date-time format e.g.
     CCYYMMDDThh:mm, CCYY-MM-DDThh, etc).

Tasks that become ready after the shutdown is ordered will be submitted
immediately if the suite is restarted.  Remaining task event handlers and job
poll and kill commands, however, will be executed prior to shutdown, unless
--now is used.

This command exits immediately unless --max-polls is greater than zero, in
which case it polls to wait for suite shutdown.

Arguments:

<div class="highlight-none notranslate" id="command-suite-state"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   Usage: cylc suite-state REG [OPTIONS]

Print task states retrieved from a suite database; or (with --task,
--point, and --status) poll until a given task reaches a given state; or (with
--task, --point, and --message) poll until a task receives a given message.
Polling is configurable with --interval and --max-polls; for a one-off
check use --max-polls=1. The suite database does not need to exist at
the time polling commences but allocated polls are consumed waiting for
it (consider max-polls*interval as an overall timeout).

Note for non-cycling tasks --point=1 must be provided.

For your own suites the database location is determined by your
site/user config. For other suites, e.g. those owned by others, or
mirrored suite databases, use --run-dir=DIR to specify the location.

Example usages:
  cylc suite-state REG --task=TASK --point=POINT --status=STATUS
returns 0 if TASK.POINT reaches STATUS before the maximum number of
polls, otherwise returns 1.

  cylc suite-state REG --task=TASK --point=POINT --status=STATUS --offset=PT6H
adds 6 hours to the value of CYCLE for carrying out the polling operation.

  cylc suite-state REG --task=TASK --status=STATUS --task-point
uses CYLC_TASK_CYCLE_POINT environment variable as the value for the CYCLE
to poll. This is useful when you want to use cylc suite-state in a cylc task.


Arguments:
   REG               Suite name

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

  -p CYCLE, --point=CYCLE
                        Specify the cycle point to check task states for.
  -T, --task-point      Use the CYLC_TASK_CYCLE_POINT environment variable as
                        the cycle point to check task states for. Shorthand
                        for --point=$CYLC_TASK_CYCLE_POINT

  -d DIR, --run-dir=DIR
                        The top level cylc run directory if non-standard. The
                        database should be DIR/REG/log/db. Use to interrogate
                        suites owned by others, etc.; see note above.

<div class="highlight-none notranslate" id="command-test-battery"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   cd &quot;/home/oliverh/cylc&quot;
Usage: cylc test-battery [...]

Run automated Cylc and Parsec tests, under (by default):
   /home/oliverh/cylc/tests/.

Options and arguments are appended to &quot;prove -j $NPROC -s -r ${@:-tests}&quot;.
NPROC is the number of concurrent processes to run, which defaults to the
global config &quot;process pool size&quot; setting.

The tests ignore normal site/user global config and instead use the file:
   /home/oliverh/cylc/etc/global-tests.rc
This should specify test job hosts under the [test battery] section, plus any
other critical settings settings, including [hosts] configuration for test job
hosts (and special batchview commands like qcat if available). Additional
global config items can be added on the fly using the create_test_globalrc
shell function defined in the test_header.

Suite run directories are only cleaned up for passing tests on the suite host.

Set &quot;export CYLC_TEST_DEBUG=true&quot; to print failed-test stderr to the terminal.

To change the test file comparision command from &quot;diff -u&quot; do (for example):
   export CYLC_TEST_DIFF_CMD=&#39;xxdiff -D&#39;

Some test suites submit jobs to the &#39;at&#39; so atd must be up on the job hosts.

Commits or Pull Requests to cylc/cylc on GitHub will trigger Travis CI to run
generic (non platform-specific) tests - see /home/oliverh/cylc/.travis.yml.

By default all tests are executed.  To run just a subset of them:
  * list individual tests or test directories to run on the comand line
  * list individual tests or test directories to skip in $CYLC_TEST_SKIP
  * skip all generic tests with CYLC_TEST_RUN_GENERIC=false
  * skip all platform-specific tests with CYLC_TEST_RUN_PLATFORM=false
  List specific tests relative to /home/oliverh/cylc (i.e. starting with &quot;test/&quot;).
Some platform-specific tests are automatically skipped, depending on platform.

Platform-specific tests must set &quot;CYLC_TEST_IS_GENERIC=false&quot; before sourcing
the test_header.

Tests requiring the sqlite3 CLI must be skipped if sqlite3 is not installed (it
is not otherwise a Cylc software prerequisite):
| if ! which sqlite3 &gt; /dev/null; then
|     # Skip the remaining 3 tests.
|     skip 3 &quot;sqlite3 not installed?&quot;
|     purge_suite $SUITE_NAME
|     exit 0
| fi

Options:
  -h, --help       Print this help message and exit.
  --chunk CHUNK    Divide the test battery into chunks and run the specified
                   chunk. CHUNK takes the format &#39;a/b&#39; where &#39;b&#39; is the number
                   of chunks to divide the battery into and &#39;a&#39; is the number
                   of the chunk to run (1 &gt;= a &gt;= b).

Examples:

Run the full test suite with the default options.
  cylc test-battery
Run the full test suite with 12 processes
  cylc test-battery -j 12
Run only tests under &quot;tests/cyclers/&quot;
  cylc test-battery tests/cyclers
Run only &quot;tests/cyclers/16-weekly.t&quot; in verbose mode
  cylc test-battery -v tests/cyclers/16-weekly.t
Run only tests under &quot;tests/cyclers/&quot;, and skip 00-daily.t
  export CYLC_TEST_SKIP=tests/cyclers/00-daily.t
  cylc test-battery tests/cyclers
Run the first quarter of the test battery
  cylc test-battery --chunk &#39;1/4&#39;
Re-run failed tests

<div class="highlight-none notranslate" id="command-trigger"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>   Usage: cylc [control] trigger [OPTIONS] REG [TASKID ...]

Manually trigger one or more tasks. Waiting tasks will be queued (cylc internal
queues) and will submit as normal when released by the queue; queued tasks will
submit immediately even if that violates the queue limit (so you may need to
trigger a queue-limited task twice to get it to submit).

For single tasks you can use &quot;--edit&quot; to edit the generated job script before
it submits, to apply one-off changes. A diff between the original and edited
job script will be saved to the task job log directory.

TASKID is a pattern to match task proxies or task families, or groups of them:
* [CYCLE-POINT-GLOB/]TASK-NAME-GLOB[:TASK-STATE]
* [CYCLE-POINT-GLOB/]FAMILY-NAME-GLOB[:TASK-STATE]
* TASK-NAME-GLOB[.CYCLE-POINT-GLOB][:TASK-STATE]
* FAMILY-NAME-GLOB[.CYCLE-POINT-GLOB][:TASK-STATE]

For example, to match:
* all tasks in a cycle: &#39;20200202T0000Z/*&#39; or &#39;*.20200202T0000Z&#39;
* all tasks in the submitted status: &#39;:submitted&#39;
* retrying &#39;foo*&#39; tasks in 0000Z cycles: &#39;foo*.*0000Z:retrying&#39; or
  &#39;*0000Z/foo*:retrying&#39;
* retrying tasks in &#39;BAR&#39; family: &#39;*/BAR:retrying&#39; or &#39;BAR.*:retrying&#39;
* retrying tasks in &#39;BAR&#39; or &#39;BAZ&#39; families: &#39;*/BA[RZ]:retrying&#39; or
  &#39;BA[RZ].*:retrying&#39;

The old &#39;MATCH POINT&#39; syntax will be automatically detected and supported. To
avoid this, use the &#39;--no-multitask-compat&#39; option, or use the new syntax
(with a &#39;/&#39; or a &#39;.&#39;) when specifying 2 TASKID arguments.

Arguments:
   REG                        Suite name
   [TASKID ...]               Task identifiers

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -e, --edit            Manually edit the job script before running it.
  -g, --geditor         (with --edit) force use of the configured GUI editor.
  --user=USER           Other user account name. This results in command
                        reinvocation on the remote account.
  --host=HOST           Other host name. This results in command reinvocation
                        on the remote account.
  -v, --verbose         Verbose output mode.
  --debug               Output developer information and show exception
                        tracebacks.
  --port=INT            Suite port number on the suite host. NOTE: this is
                        retrieved automatically if non-interactive ssh is
                        configured to the suite host.
  --use-ssh             Use ssh to re-invoke the command on the suite host.
  --ssh-cylc=SSH_CYLC   Location of cylc executable on remote ssh commands.
  --no-login            Do not use a login shell to run remote ssh commands.
                        The default is to use a login shell.
  --comms-timeout=SEC, --pyro-timeout=SEC
                        Set a timeout for network connections to the running
                        suite. The default is no timeout. For task messaging
                        connections see site/user config file documentation.
  --print-uuid          Print the client UUID to stderr. This can be matched
                        to information logged by the receiving suite server
                        program.
  --set-uuid=UUID       Set the client UUID manually (e.g. from prior use of
                        --print-uuid). This can be used to log multiple
                        commands under the same UUID (but note that only the
                        first [info] command from the same client ID will be
                        logged unless the suite is running in debug mode).
  -f, --force           Do not ask for confirmation before acting. Note that
                        it is not necessary to use this option if interactive
                        command prompts have been disabled in the site/user
                        config files.
  -m, --family          (Obsolete) This option is now ignored and is retained
                        for backward compatibility only. TASKID in the
                        argument list can be used to match task and family
                        names regardless of this option.
  --no-multitask-compat
                        Disallow backward compatible multitask interface.

<p>The graph view in the gcylc GUI shows the structure of the suite as it
evolves. It can work well even for large suites, but be aware that the
Graphviz layout engine has to do a new global layout every time a task
proxy appears in or disappears from the task pool. The following may help
mitigate any jumping layout problems:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The disconnect button can be used to temporarily prevent the
graph from changing as the suite evolves.</li>
<li>The greyed-out base nodes, which are only present to fill out
the graph structure, can be toggled off (but this will split the
graph into disconnected sub-trees).</li>
<li>Right-click on a task and choose the “Focus” option to restrict
the graph display to that task’s cycle point. Anything interesting
happening in other cycle points will show up as disconnected
rectangular nodes to the right of the graph (and you can click on
those to instantly refocus to their cycle points).</li>
<li>Task filtering is the ultimate quick route to focusing on just
the tasks you’re interested in, but this will destroy the graph
structure.</li>

Cylc (“silk”) orchestrates complex distributed suites of interdependent cycling
(or non-cycling) tasks. It was originally designed to automate environmental
forecasting systems at [NIWA](https://www.niwa.co.nz). Cylc is a general
workflow engine, however; it is not specialized to forecasting in any way.

<h3>15.9. Cylc INSTALL File<a class="headerlink" href="#cylc-install-file" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># Cylc: Quick Installation Guide

**See [The Cylc User Guide](https://cylc.github.io/cylc/documentation.html) for
more detailed information.**

Cylc must be installed on suite and task job hosts. Third-party dependencies
(below) are not required on job hosts.

### Third-party Software Packages

Install the packages listed in the **Installation** section of the User Guide.
See also *Check Software Installation* below.

### Installing Cylc

Download the latest tarball from [Cylc
Releases](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/releases).

Successive Cylc releases should be installed side-by-side under a location
such as `/opt`:

```bash
cd /opt
tar xzf cylc-7.7.0.tar.gz
# DO NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF THE UNPACKED CYLC SOURCE DIRECTORY.
cd cylc-7.7.0
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH
make
```

Then make (or update) a symlink to the latest installed version:
```bash
ln -s /opt/cylc-7.7.0 /opt/cylc
```

When you type `make`:
  * A file called VERSION is created, containing the Cylc version number
    * The version number is taken from the name of the parent directory. DO
      NOT CHANGE THE NAME OF THE UNPACKED CYLC SOURCE DIRECTORY
  * The Cylc documentation is generated from source and put in doc/install/
    (if you have pdflatex, tex4ht, and several other LateX packages installed).

If this is the first installed version of Cylc, copy the wrapper script
`usr/bin/cylc` to a location in the system executable path, such as
`/usr/bin/` or `/usr/local/bin/`, and edit it - as per the in-file
instructions - to point to the Cylc install location:

```bash
cp /opt/cylc-7.7.0/usr/bin/cylc /usr/local/bin/
# (and EDIT /usr/local/bin/cylc as instructed)
```

The wrapper is designed invoke the latest (symlinked) version of Cylc by
default, or else a particular version determined by `$CYLC_VERSION` or
`$CYLC_HOME` in your environment. This is how a long-running suite server
program ensures that the jobs it manages invoke clients at the right cylc
version.

<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>pre-cylc-3</strong><ul>
<li>early versions focused on the new
scheduling algorithm. A suite was a collection of “task definition files”
that encoded the prerequisites and outputs of each task,
exposing cylc’s self-organising nature. Tasks could be transferred
from one suite to another by simply copying their taskdef files over
and checking prerequisite and output consistency. Global suite
structure was not easy to discern until run time (although cylc-2
could generate resolved run time dependency graphs).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>cylc-3</strong><ul>
<li>a new suite design interface: dependency graph and task runtime properties
defined in a single structured, validated, configuration file - the
suite.rc file</li>
<li>graphical user interface</li>
<li>suite graphing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>cylc-4</strong><ul>
<li>refined and organized the suite.rc file structure</li>
<li>task runtime properties defined by an efficient inheritance hierarchy</li>
<li>support for the Jinja2 template processor in suite configurations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>cylc-5</strong><ul>
<li>multi-threading for continuous network request handling and job submission</li>
<li>more task states to distinguish job submission from execution</li>
<li>dependence between suites via new suite run databases</li>
<li>polling and killing of real task jobs</li>
<li>polling as task communications option.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>cylc-6</strong><ul>
<li>specification of all date-times and cycling workflows via the ISO8601
date-times, durations, and recurrence expressions</li>
<li>integer cycling</li>
<li>a multi-process pool to execute job submissions, event handlers, and poll
and kill commands.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>cylc-7</strong><ul>
<li>Replaced the Pyro communications layer with RESTful HTTPS</li>
<li>Removed deprecated pre cylc-6 syntax and features.</li>

a purely numeric form before cylc 6, in seconds, minutes (most common), or
hours, depending on the setting.</p>
<p>They are now written in an ISO 8601 duration form, which has the benefit
that the units are user-selectable (use 1 day instead of 1440 minutes)

<p>This change is to reflect the fact that cycling in cylc 6+ can now be over
e.g. integers instead of being purely based on date-time.</p>
<p>Date-times written in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">initial</span> <span class="pre">cycle</span> <span class="pre">time</span></code> and

<p>In bash, the return status of a pipeline is normally the exit status of the
last command. This is unsafe, because if any command in the pipeline fails, the
script will continue nevertheless.</p>
<p>For safety, a cylc task job script running in bash will have the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">set</span> <span class="pre">-o</span> <span class="pre">pipefail</span></code> option turned on automatically. If a pipeline
exists in a task’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">script</span></code>, etc section, the failure of any part of
a pipeline will cause the command to return a non-zero code at the end, which
will be reported as a task job failure. Due to the unique nature of a pipeline,
the job file will trap the failure of the individual commands, as well as the
whole pipeline, and will attempt to report a failure back to the suite twice.
The second message is ignored by the suite, and so the behaviour can be safely
ignored. (You should probably still investigate the failure, however!)</p>

<p>This document provides guidance on making complex Cylc + Rose workflows that
are clear, maintainable, and portable. Note that best practice advice may
evolve over time with the capabilities of Rose and Cylc.</p>
<p>Content is drawn from the Rose and Cylc user guides, earlier Met Office suite
design and operational suite review documents, experience with real suites
across the Unified Model Consortium, and discussion among members of the UM
TISD (Technical Infrastructure Suite Design) working group.</p>
<p>We start with the most general topics (coding style, general principles),
move on to more advanced topics (efficiency and maintainability, portable
suites), and end with some pointers to future developments.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>A good working knowledge of Cylc and Rose is assumed. For further details,

<h3>16.2. Style Guidelines<a class="headerlink" href="#style-guidelines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Coding style is largely subjective, but for collaborative development of
complex systems it is important to settle on a clear and consistent style to
avoid getting into a mess. The following style rules are recommended.</p>
<div class="section" id="tab-characters">
<h4>16.2.1. Tab Characters<a class="headerlink" href="#tab-characters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Do not use tab characters. Tab width depends on editor settings, so a mixture
of tabs and spaces in the same file can render to a mess.</p>
<p>Use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">grep</span> <span class="pre">-InPr</span> <span class="pre">&quot;\t&quot;</span> <span class="pre">*</span></code> to find tabs recursively in files in
a directory.</p>
<p>In <em>vim</em> use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">%retab</span></code> to convert existing tabs to spaces,
and set <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">expandtab</span></code> to automatically convert new tabs.</p>
<p>In <em>emacs</em> use <em>whitespace-cleanup</em>.</p>
<p>In <em>gedit</em>, use the <em>Draw Spaces</em> plugin to display tabs and spaces.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="trailing-whitespace">
<h4>16.2.2. Trailing Whitespace<a class="headerlink" href="#trailing-whitespace" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Trailing whitespace is untidy, it makes quick reformatting of paragraphs
difficult, and it can result in hard-to-find bugs (space after intended
line continuation markers).</p>
<p>To remove existing trailing whitespace in a file use a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sed</span></code> or
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">perl</span></code> one-liner:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ perl -pi -e <span class="s2">&quot;s/ +</span>$<span class="s2">//g&quot;</span> /path/to/file
<span class="c1"># or:</span>
$ sed --in-place <span class="s1">&#39;s/[[:space:]]\+$//&#39;</span> path/to/file
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Or do a similar search-and-replace operation in your editor. Editors like
<em>vim</em> and <em>emacs</em> can also be configured to highlight or automatically
remove trailing whitespace on the fly.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="indentation">
<h4>16.2.3. Indentation<a class="headerlink" href="#indentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Consistent indentation makes a suite definition more readable, it shows section
nesting clearly, and it makes block re-indentation operations easier in text
editors. Indent suite.rc syntax four spaces per nesting level:</p>
<div class="section" id="config-items">
<h5>16.2.3.1. Config Items<a class="headerlink" href="#config-items" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[SECTION]</span>
    <span class="c1"># A comment.</span>
    <span class="nv">title </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> the quick brown fox</span>
    <span class="nt">[[SUBSECTION]]</span>
        <span class="c1"># Another comment.</span>
        <span class="nv">a short item </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> value1</span>
        <span class="nv">a very very long item </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> value2</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Don’t align <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">item</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">value</span></code> pairs on the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">=</span></code> character
like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[SECTION]</span>  <span class="c1"># Avoid this.</span>
             <span class="nv">a short item </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> value1</span>
    <span class="nv">a very very long item </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> value2</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>or like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[SECTION]</span>  <span class="c1"># Avoid this.</span>
    <span class="nv">a short item          </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> value1</span>
    <span class="nv">a very very long item </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> value2</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>because the whole block may need re-indenting after a single change, which will
pollute your revision history with spurious changes.</p>
<p>Comments should be indented to the same level as the section or item they refer
to, and trailing comments should be preceded by two spaces, as shown above.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="script-string-lines">
<h5>16.2.3.2. Script String Lines<a class="headerlink" href="#script-string-lines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Script strings are written verbatim to task job scripts so they should really
be indented from the left margin:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[runtime]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[foo]]</span>
        <span class="c1"># Recommended.</span>
        <span class="nv">post-script </span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="s2">if [[ $RESULT == &quot;bad&quot; ]]; then</span>
<span class="s2">    echo Goodbye World!</span>
<span class="s2">    exit 1</span>
<span class="s2">fi&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Indentation is <em>mostly</em> ignored by the bash interpreter, but is useful for
readability. It is <em>mostly</em> harmless to indent internal script lines as if
part of the Cylc syntax, or even out to the triple quotes:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[runtime]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[foo]]</span>
        <span class="c1"># OK, but...</span>
        <span class="nv">post-script </span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="s2">            if [[ $RESULT == &quot;bad&quot; ]]; then</span>
<span class="s2">                echo Goodbye World!</span>
<span class="s2">                exit 1</span>
<span class="s2">            fi&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>On parsing the triple quoted value, Cylc will remove any common leading
whitespace from each line using the logic of
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/textwrap.html#textwrap.dedent">Python’s textwrap.dedent</a>
so the script block would end up being the same as the previous example.
However, you should watch your line length (see <a class="reference internal" href="#line-length"><span class="std std-ref">Line Length And Continuation</span></a>) when you
have many levels of indentations.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Take care when indenting here documents:</p>
<div class="last highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[runtime]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[foo]]</span>
     <span class="nv">script </span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="s2">     cat &gt;&gt; log.txt &lt;&lt;_EOF_</span>
<span class="s2">         The quick brown fox jumped</span>
<span class="s2">         over the lazy dog.</span>
<span class="s2">     _EOF_</span>
<span class="s2">              &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the above, each line in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">log.txt</span></code> would end up with 4 leading
white spaces. The following will give you lines with no white spaces.</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[runtime]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[foo]]</span>
        <span class="nv">script </span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>

<p>Suites can have many small simple tasks, fewer large complex tasks, or anything
in between. A task that runs many distinct processes can be split into many
distinct tasks. The fine-grained approach is more transparent and it allows
more task level concurrency and quicker failure recovery - you can rerun just
what failed without repeating anything unnecessarily.</p>

similar concurrent jobs you can use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rose</span> <span class="pre">bunch</span></code> to pack them into a

<p>When writing suites from scratch you may need to decide between putting
multiple loosely connected sub-workflows into a single large suite, or
constructing a more modular system of smaller suites that depend on each other
through inter-suite triggering. Each approach has its pros and cons, depending
on your requirements and preferences with respect to the complexity and
manageability of the resulting system.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">gscan</span></code> GUI lets you monitor multiple suites at a time, and
you can define virtual groups of suites that collapse into a single state
summary.</p>
<div class="section" id="inter-suite-triggering">
<h5>16.3.3.1. Inter-Suite Triggering<a class="headerlink" href="#inter-suite-triggering" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>A task in one suite can explicitly trigger off of a task in another suite. The
full range of possible triggering conditions is supported, including custom
message triggers. Remote triggering involves repeatedly querying (“polling”)
the remote suite run database, not the suite server program, so it works even
if the other suite is down at the time.</p>
<p>There is special graph syntax to support triggering off of a task in another
suite, or you can call the underlying <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cylc</span> <span class="pre">suite-state</span></code> command
directly in task scripting.</p>

task.</p>

all of this is confined to the suite run directory too, as far as possible.</p>
<p>Self-contained suites are more robust, easier to work with, and more portable.

they don’t slow the suite start-up process, they can be monitored in the GUI,
they can run directly on target platforms, and you can rerun them later without
restarting the suite. If you are using symbolic links to install files under
your suite directory it is recommended that the linking should be set up to

<h4>16.3.7. Rose Apps<a class="headerlink" href="#rose-apps" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Rose apps allow all non-shared task configuration - which is not relevant to

files. This makes suites tidier and easier to understand, and it allows

<p>Clock-triggered tasks typically have to handle late data arrival. Task
execution <em>retry delays</em> can be used to simply retrigger the task at

for what is a essentially a normal condition (at least it is normal until the
data is really late).</p>
<p>Rather than using task execution retry delays to repeatedly trigger a task that
checks for a file, it may be better to have the task itself repeatedly poll for
the data (see <a class="reference internal" href="#rose-app-file-polling"><span class="std std-ref">Rose App File Polling</span></a> for example).</p>

<p>Ongoing cycling suites can generate an enormous number of output files and logs
so regular housekeeping is very important. Special housekeeping tasks,
typically the last tasks in each cycle, should be included to archive selected
important files and then delete everything at some offset from the current
cycle point.</p>
<p>The Rose built-in apps <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rose_arch</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rose_prune</span></code>
provide an easy way to do this. They can be configured easily with
file-matching patterns and cycle point offsets to perform various housekeeping
operations on matched files.</p>

<h4>16.3.15. Complex Jinja2 Code<a class="headerlink" href="#complex-jinja2-code" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Jinja2 template processor provides general programming constructs,
extensible with custom Python filters, that can be used to <em>generate</em> the
suite definition. This makes it possible to write flexible multi-use
suites with structure and content that varies according to various input
switches. There is a cost to this flexibility however: excessive use of Jinja2
can make a suite hard to understand and maintain. It is difficult to say
exactly where to draw the line, but we recommend erring on the side of
simplicity and clarity: write suites that are easy to understand and therefore
easy to modify for other purposes, rather than extremely complicated suites
that attempt do everything out of the box but are hard to maintain and modify.</p>
<p>Note that use of Jinja2 loops for generating tasks is now deprecated in favour
of built-in parameterized tasks - see <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#parameterized-tasks-label"><span class="std std-ref">Parameterized Tasks</span></a>.</p>

<h5>16.3.16.2. Inheritance<a class="headerlink" href="#inheritance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Sharing by inheritance of task families is recommended when more than a few
configuration items are involved.</p>
<p>The simplest application of inheritance is to set global defaults in the
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[[runtime]][root]</span></code> namespace that is inherited by all tasks.
However, this should only be done for settings that really are used
by the vast majority of tasks. Over-sharing of via root, particularly of
environment variables, is a maintenance risk because it can be very
difficult to be sure which tasks are <em>using</em> which global variables.</p>
<p>Any <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[runtime]</span></code> settings can be shared - scripting, host
and batch scheduler configuration, environment variables, and so on - from
single items up to complete task or app configurations.  At the latter extreme,
it is quite common to have several tasks that inherit the same complete
job configuration followed by minor task-specific additions:</p>

<div class="section" id="shared-task-io-paths">
<span id="id10"></span><h5>16.3.16.3. Shared Task IO Paths<a class="headerlink" href="#shared-task-io-paths" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>If one task uses files generated by another task (and both see the same
filesystem) a common IO path should normally be passed to both tasks via a
shared environment variable. As far as Cylc is concerned this is no different
to other shared configuration items, but there are some additional aspects
of usage worth addressing here.</p>
<p>Primarily, for self-containment (see <a class="reference internal" href="#self-contained-suites"><span class="std std-ref">Self-Contained Suites</span></a>) shared IO
paths should be under the <em>suite share directory</em>, the location of which is
passed to all tasks as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$CYLC_SUITE_SHARE_PATH</span></code>.</p>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rose</span> <span class="pre">task-env</span></code> utility can provide additional environment
variables that refer to static and cyclepoint-specific locations under the
suite share directory.</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[runtime]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[my-task]]</span>
        <span class="nv">env-script </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> $(eval rose task-env -T P1D -T P2D)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>For a current cycle point of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">20170105</span></code> this will make the following
variables available to tasks:</p>
<div class="highlight-bash notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nv">ROSE_DATA</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$CYLC_SUITE_SHARE_PATH</span>/data
<span class="nv">ROSE_DATAC</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$CYLC_SUITE_SHARE_PATH</span>/cycle/20170105
<span class="nv">ROSE_DATACP1D</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$CYLC_SUITE_SHARE_PATH</span>/cycle/20170104
<span class="nv">ROSE_DATACP2D</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nv">$CYLC_SUITE_SHARE_PATH</span>/cycle/20170103
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Subdirectories of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$ROSE_DATAC</span></code> etc. should be agreed between
different sub-systems of the suite; typically they are named for the
file-generating tasks, and the file-consuming tasks should know to look there.</p>
<p>The share-not-duplicate rule can be relaxed for shared files whose names are
agreed by convention, so long as their locations under the share directory are
proper shared suite variables. For instance the Unified Model uses a large
number of files whose conventional names (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">glu_snow</span></code>, for example)
can reasonably be expected not to change, so they are typically hardwired into
app configurations (as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$ROSE_DATA/glu_snow</span></code>, for example) to avoid
cluttering the suite definition.</p>
<p>Here two tasks share a workspace under the suite share directory
by inheritance:</p>

<p>For completeness we note that it is also possible to configure multiple tasks
to use the same work directory so they can all share files in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$PWD</span></code>.
(Cylc executes task jobs in special work directories that by default are unique
to each task). This may simplify the suite slightly, and it may be useful if
you are unfortunate enough to have executables that are designed for IO in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$PWD</span></code>, <em>but it is not recommended</em>. There is a higher risk
of interference between tasks; it will break <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rose</span> <span class="pre">task-run</span></code>
incremental file creation mode; and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rose</span> <span class="pre">task-run</span> <span class="pre">--new</span></code> will in
effect delete the work directories of tasks other than its intended target.</p>

<p>A properly designed family hierarchy fulfils three purposes in Cylc:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>efficient sharing of all configuration common to groups of related
tasks</li>
<li>efficient bulk triggering, for clear scheduling graphs</li>
<li>clean suite visualization and monitoring, because families are
collapsible in the GUIs</li>
</ul>

<span id="id3"></span><h5>16.4.1.1. Sharing By Inheritance<a class="headerlink" href="#sharing-by-inheritance" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Duplication is a maintenance risk because changes have to be repeated in
multiple places without mistakes. On the other hand, unnecessary sharing of
items via global variables is also bad because it is hard to be sure which
tasks are using which variables. A properly designed runtime inheritance
hierarchy can give every task exactly what it needs, and nothing that it
doesn’t need.</p>
<p>If a group of related tasks has some configuration in common, it can be
factored out into a task family inherited by all.</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[runtime]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[OBSPROC]]</span>
        <span class="c1"># Settings common to all obs processing tasks.</span>
    <span class="nt">[[obs1]]</span>
        <span class="nv">inherit </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> OBSPROC</span>
    <span class="nt">[[obs2]]</span>
        <span class="nv">inherit </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> OBSPROC</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If several families have settings in common, they can in turn can inherit
from higher-level families.</p>
<p>Multiple inheritance allows efficient sharing even for overlapping categories
of tasks. For example consider that some obs processing tasks in the following
suite run parallel jobs and some serial:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[runtime]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[SERIAL]]</span>
        <span class="c1"># Serial job settings.</span>
    <span class="nt">[[PARALLEL]]</span>
        <span class="c1"># Parallel job settings.</span>
    <span class="nt">[[OBSPROC]]</span>
        <span class="c1"># Settings for all obs processing tasks.</span>
    <span class="nt">[[obs1, obs2, obs3]]</span>
        <span class="c1"># Serial obs processing tasks.</span>
        <span class="nv">inherit </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> OBSPROC, SERIAL</span>
    <span class="nt">[[obs4, obs5]]</span>
        <span class="c1"># Parallel obs processing tasks.</span>
        <span class="nv">inherit </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> OBSPROC, PARALLEL</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that suite parameters should really be used to define family members
efficiently - see <a class="reference internal" href="#generating-tasks"><span class="std std-ref">Generating Tasks Automatically</span></a>.</p>

<h5>16.4.1.2. Family Triggering<a class="headerlink" href="#family-triggering" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Task families can be used to simplify the scheduling graph wherever many
tasks need to trigger at once:</p>

        <span class="nv">inherit </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> MODELS</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To trigger <em>off of</em> many tasks at once, family names need to be qualified
by <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;state&gt;-all</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&lt;state&gt;-any</span></code> to indicate the desired
member-triggering semantics:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[dependencies]]</span>
        <span class="nv">graph</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span><span class="kd">pre</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kd">MODELS</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note that this can be simplified further because Cylc ignores trigger
qualifiers like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">:succeed-all</span></code> on the right of trigger arrows

<span id="portable-suites-label"></span><h3>16.5. Portable Suites<a class="headerlink" href="#portable-suites" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A <em>portable</em> or <em>interoperable</em> suite can run “out of the box” at
different sites, or in different environments such as research and operations
within a site.  For convenience we just use the term <em>site portability</em>.</p>
<p>Lack of portability is a major barrier to collaborative development when
sites need to run more or less the same workflow, because it is very
difficult to translate changes manually between large, complicated suites.</p>
<p>Most suites are riddled with site-specific details such as local build
configurations, file paths, host names, and batch scheduler directives, etc.;
but it is possible to cleanly factor all this out to make a portable suite.
Significant variations in workflow structure can even be accommodated quite
easily. If the site workflows are <em>too different</em>, however, you may decide
that it is appropriate for each site to maintain separate suites.</p>
<p>The recommended way to do this, which we expand on below, is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Put all site-specific settings in include-files loaded at the end
of a generic “core” suite definition.</li>
<li>Use “optional” app config files for site-specific variations
in the core suite’s Rose apps.</li>
<li>(Make minimal use of inlined site switches too, if necessary).</li>
<li>When referencing files, reference them within the suite structure and
use an install task to link external files in.</li>
</ul>
<p>The result should actually be tidier than the original in one respect: all
the messy platform-specific resource directives etc., will be hidden away in
the site include-files.</p>

name, either in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rose-suite.conf</span></code>, or in the suite definition itself
(perhaps automatically, by querying the local environment in some way).</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="ch">#!Jinja2</span>
<span class="cp">{% set SITE = &quot;niwa&quot; %}</span>

<h4>16.5.2. Site Include-Files<a class="headerlink" href="#site-include-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>If a section heading in a suite.rc file is repeated the items under it simply
add to or override those defined under the same section earlier in the file
(but note <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#list-item-override-in-site-include-files"><span class="std std-ref">List Item Override In Site Include-Files</span></a>).
For example, this task definition:</p>

<div class="admonition note">

<p>In this way all site-specific <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">[runtime]</span></code> settings, with their

<div class="section" id="inlined-site-switching">
<span id="id1"></span><h4>16.5.4. Inlined Site-Switching<a class="headerlink" href="#inlined-site-switching" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>It may be tempting to use inlined switch blocks throughout the suite instead of
site include-files, but <em>this is not recommended</em> - it is verbose and
untidy (the greater the number of supported sites, the bigger the
mess) and it exposes all site configuration to all users:</p>

<span class="cp">{% endif %}</span>
    <span class="c1">#...</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Inlined switches can be used, however, to configure exceptional behaviour at
one site without requiring the other sites to duplicate the default behaviour.
But be wary of accumulating too many of these switches:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># (core suite.rc file)</span>
<span class="c1">#...</span>
<span class="cp">{% if SITE == &#39;small&#39; %}</span>
   <span class="c c-Multi">{# We can&#39;t run 100 members... #}</span>
   <span class="cp">{% set ENSEMBLE_SIZE = 25 %}</span>
<span class="cp">{% else %}</span>
   <span class="c c-Multi">{# ...but everyone else can! #}</span>
   <span class="cp">{% set ENSEMBLE_SIZE = 100 %}</span>
<span class="cp">{% endif %}</span>
<span class="c1">#...</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Inlined switches can also be used to temporarily isolate a site-specific
change to a hitherto non site-specific part of the suite, thereby avoiding the
need to update all site include-files before getting agreement from the suite
owner and collaborators.</p>

<div class="section" id="site-specific-suite-variables">
<h4>16.5.5. Site-Specific Suite Variables<a class="headerlink" href="#site-specific-suite-variables" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>It can sometimes be useful to set site-specific values of suite variables that
aren’t exposed to users via <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rose-suite.conf</span></code>. For example, consider
a suite that can run a special post-processing workflow of some kind at sites
where IDL is available. The IDL-dependence switch can be set per site like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1">#...</span>
<span class="cp">{% from SITE ~ &#39;-vars.rc&#39; import HAVE_IDL, OTHER_VAR %}</span>

<span class="cp">{% endif %}</span>
        <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SITE</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">niwa</span></code> the file <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">niwa-vars.rc</span></code> contains:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c c-Multi">{# niwa-vars.rc #}</span>
<span class="cp">{% set HAVE_IDL = True %}</span>
<span class="cp">{% set OTHER_VAR = &quot;the quick brown fox&quot; %}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Note we are assuming there are significantly fewer options (IDL or not, in this
case) than sites, otherwise the IDL workflow should just go in the site
include-files of the sites that need it.</p>

<h4>16.5.6. Site-Specific Optional Suite Configs<a class="headerlink" href="#site-specific-optional-suite-configs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>During development and testing of a portable suite you can use an optional Rose
suite config file to automatically set site-specific suite inputs and thereby
avoid the need to make manual changes every time you check out and run a new
version. The site switch itself has to be set of course, but there may be other
settings too such as model parameters for a standard local test domain. Just
put these settings in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">opt/rose-suite-niwa.conf</span></code> (for site “niwa”)
and run the suite with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rose</span> <span class="pre">suite-run</span> <span class="pre">-O</span> <span class="pre">niwa</span></code>.</p>

<h4>16.5.7. Site-Agnostic File Paths in App Configs<a class="headerlink" href="#site-agnostic-file-paths-in-app-configs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Where possible apps should be configured to reference files within the suite
structure itself rather than outside of it. This makes the apps themselves
portable and it becomes the job of the install task to ensure all required
source files are available within the suite structure e.g. via symlink into
the share directory. Additionally, by moving the responsibility of linking
files into the suite to an install task you gain the added benefit of knowing
if a file is missing at the start of a suite rather than part way into a run.</p>

<h4>16.5.8. Site-Specific Optional App Configs<a class="headerlink" href="#site-specific-optional-app-configs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Typically a few but not all apps will need some site customization, e.g. for
local archive configuration, local science options, or whatever. To avoid
explicit site-customization of individual task-run command lines use Rose’s
built-in <em>optional app config</em> capability:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[runtime]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[root]]</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Normally a missing optional app config is considered to be an error, but the
round parentheses here mean the named optional config is optional - i.e.
use it if it exists, otherwise ignore.</p>
<p>With this setting in place we can simply add a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">opt/rose-app-niwa.conf</span></code> to
any app that needs customization at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SITE</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">niwa</span></code>.</p>

<p>Some points to note:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It is straightforward to extend support to a new site by copying an
existing site file(s) and adapting it to the new job host and batch
scheduler etc.</li>
<li>Batch system directives should be considered site-specific unless
all supported sites have the same batch system and the same host
architecture (including CPU clock speed and memory size etc.).</li>
<li>We’ve assumed that all tasks run on a single HPC host at both
sites. If that’s not a valid assumption the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">HPC</span></code> family
inheritance relationships would have to become site-specific.</li>
<li>Core task runtime configuration aren’t needed in site files at all
if their job host and batch system settings can be defined in common
families that are (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">HPC</span></code> in this case).</li>

<div class="section" id="collaborative-development-model">
<span id="id2"></span><h4>16.5.10. Collaborative Development Model<a class="headerlink" href="#collaborative-development-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Official releases of a portable suite should be made from the suite trunk.</p>
<p>Changes should be developed on feature branches so as not to affect other users
of the suite.</p>
<p>Site-specific changes shouldn’t touch the core suite.rc file, just the relevant
site include-file, and therefore should not need close scrutiny from other
sites.</p>
<p>Changes to the core suite.rc file should be agreed by all stakeholders, and
should be carefully checked for effects on site include-files:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Changing the name of tasks or families in the core suite may break
sites that add configuration to the original runtime namespace.</li>
<li>Adding new tasks or families to the core suite may require
corresponding additions to the site files.</li>
<li>Deleting tasks or families from the core suite may require
corresponding parts of the site files to be removed. And also, check for
site-specific triggering off of deleted tasks or families.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if the owner site has to get some changes into the trunk before all
collaborating sites have time to test them, version control will of course
protect those lagging behind from any immediate ill effects.</p>
<p>When a new feature is complete and tested at the developer’s site, the suite
owner should check out the branch, review and test it, and if necessary request
that other sites do the same and report back. The owner can then merge the
new feature to the trunk once satisfied.</p>
<p>All planning and discussion associated with the change should be documented on
MOSRS Trac tickets associated with the suite.</p>

<div class="section" id="research-to-operations-transition">
<h4>16.5.11. Research-To-Operations Transition<a class="headerlink" href="#research-to-operations-transition" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Under this collaborative development model it is <em>possible</em> to use the
same suite in research and operations, largely eliminating the difficult
translation between the two environments. Where appropriate, this can save
a lot of work.</p>
<p>Operations-specific parts of the suite should be factored out (as for site
portability) into include-files that are only loaded in the operational
environment. Improvements and upgrades can be developed on feature branches in
the research environment. Operations staff can check out completed feature
branches for testing in the operational environment before merging to trunk or
referring back to research if problems are found. After sufficient testing the
new suite version can be deployed into operations.</p>

<h3>16.6. Roadmap<a class="headerlink" href="#roadmap" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Several planned future developments in Rose and Cylc may have an impact on
suite design.</p>

<span id="id1"></span><h4>16.6.1. List Item Override In Site Include-Files<a class="headerlink" href="#list-item-override-in-site-include-files" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A few Cylc config items hold lists of task (or family) names, e.g.:</p>
<div class="highlight-cylc notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">[scheduling]</span>
    <span class="nt">[[special tasks]]</span>
        <span class="nv">clock-trigger </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s"> get-data-a, get-data-b</span>
    <span class="c1">#...</span>
<span class="c1">#...</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Currently a repeated config item completely overrides a previously set value
(apart from graph strings which are always additive). This means a site
include-file (for example) can’t add a new site-specific clock-triggered task
without writing out the complete list of all clock-triggered tasks in the
suite, which breaks the otherwise clean separation into core and site files.</p>

<span id="id2"></span><h4>16.6.2. UM STASH in Optional App Configs<a class="headerlink" href="#um-stash-in-optional-app-configs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A caveat to the advice on use of option app configs in
<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#optional-app-config-files"><span class="std std-ref">Optional App Config Files</span></a>: in general you might need the ability
to turn off or modify some STASH requests in the main
app, not just add additional site-specific
STASH. But overriding STASH in optional configs is fragile because STASH
namelists names are automatically generated from a <em>hash</em> of the precise
content of the namelist. This makes it possible to uniquely identify the same
STASH requests in different apps, but if any detail of a STASH request changes
in a main app its namelist name will change and any optional configs that refer
to it will become divorced from their intended target.</p>
<p>Until this problem is solved we recommend that:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>All STASH in main UM apps should be grouped into sensible
<em>packages</em> that can be turned on and off in optional configs without
referencing the individual STASH request namelists.</li>
<li>Or all STASH should be held in optional site configs and none in the
main app. Note however that STASH is difficult to configure outside of
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rose</span> <span class="pre">edit</span></code>, and the editor <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/metomi/rose/issues/1685">does not yet allow you to edit optional
configs</a>.</li>

<div class="section" id="modular-suite-design">
<h4>16.6.3. Modular Suite Design<a class="headerlink" href="#modular-suite-design" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cylc/cylc/issues/1829">modular suite design concept</a>
is that we should be able to import common workflow segments at install time
rather than duplicating them in each suite. The content of a suite module
will be encapsulated in a protected namespace to avoid clashing with the
importing suite, and selected inputs and outputs exposed via a proper interface.</p>
<p>This should aid portable suite design too by enabling site-specific parts of a
workflow (local product generation for example) to be stored and imported
on-site rather than polluting the source and revision control record of
the core suite that everyone sees.</p>
<p>We note that this can already be done to a limited extent by using
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">rose</span> <span class="pre">suite-run</span></code> to install suite.rc fragments from an external
location. However, as a literal inlining mechanism with no encapsulation or
interface, the internals of the “imported” fragments would have to be
compatible with the suite definition in every respect.</p>
