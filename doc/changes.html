<a name="5.0.2"/>
		<h2>5.0.2 pending</h2>

<ul>
		<li> <b>Bug fix for warm starts</b> - a function <code>plog()</code>
		that no longer exists was called on warm starting.</li>

		<li> <b>Bug fixes for doc/Makefile:</b> - "make clean" was not
		working, and a fatal error occured if htlatex was not installed.</li>

</ul>


<a name="5.0.1"/>
		<h2>5.0.1</h2>

<ul>
		<li> <b>Bug fix for 5.0.0 batched job submission:</b> a job
		submission failure would cause cylc to abort.</li>

		<li> <b>Changed "log root" filenames</b> (i.e. task job script plus
		stdout and stderr logs, and <code>$CYLC_TASK_LOG_ROOT</code>
		in task environments): replaced seconds-since-epoch with a simple
		<i>submit number</i> that increments on retries and manual
		triggering.</li>

		<li> Added a suite definition <b>syntax file</b> for the
		<b>gedit</b> editor and other gtksourceview programs:
		<code>conf/cylc.lang</code>.</li>

</ul>

<a name="5.0.0"/>
<h2>5.0.0</h2>

<ul>
		<li> <b>Multi-threading</b>: cylc now does continous request
		handling, batched task job submission, and batched event handler
		execution, in background threads. This has big performance
		benefits for large, busy, suites.</li>

		<li> Cylc now runs in <b>daemon mode</b> - no need to use nohup
		anymore.</li>

		<li> <b>Major change in suite restart behavior</b>: tasks recorded
		in the submitted, running, or failed states are no longer triggered
		automatically on restarting, because that is not always desirable.</li>

		<li> A new command can <b>broadcast runtime settings to tasks in
		a running suite</b>, overriding their configured settings. One way to
		use this: <b>tasks can communicate environment variables to other
				tasks downstream of them</b>.  Broadcast settings persist across
		restarts.</li> 

		<li> <b>Reloading the suite definition at run time</b> is now
		supported. Even task definitions can be added and removed without
		stopping and restarting the suite.</li>

		<li> <b>Restarting after deleting task definitions</b> now works 
		without modifying the state dump.</li>

		<li> <b>Dynamic host selection</b> is officially supported.</li>

		<li> New <b>family trigger syntax</b> allows any family finish
		semantics, with use of conditional operators.</li>

		<li> Higher level <b>family triggers</b> (families of
		families) can now be used in the graph.</li>

		<li> New <b>site and user config files</b> some former suite
		definition items, and other global settings, can now be configured 
		globally.</li> 

		<li> The <b>runahead limit</b> now automatically defaults to the
		twice the smallest cycling interval in a suite, and setting it too
		low can no longer stall a suite.</li>

		<li> <b>Self-diagnosing test suites</b> can now be created to test
		that cylc upgrades will not break your systems; see
		"Reference Tests" in the User Guide.</li> 

		<li> The <b>suite control GUI "gcontrol" has been renamed
				"gcylc"</b> as it now has suite preparation capability too
		(editing, graphing, validating, etc.); the former "gcylc" GUI is
		still available as <code>cylc dbviewer</code>.</li>

		<li> Configurable <b>gcylc task state color themes</b> common to all
		views.</li>

		<li> The <b>gcylc dot view</b> now has hover-over task state
		information, and right-click menus.</li>

		<li> The <b>gcylc graph view</b> now has:
		<ul>
				<li> <b>family node</b> state coloring and mouse-hover member
				state information</li>
				<li> <b>landscape mode</b></li>
				<li> <b>reduced redraw</b> (i.e. the graph jumps around less)</li>
				<li> <b>"cycle time focus"</b> now works (broken between 4.2.2 and 4.5.1)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>

		<li> <b>gcylc: less frequent polling</b> for stopped suites, to
		reduce network traffic. A polling reset button can be used to
		reconnect to a restarted suite immediately.</li>

		<li> <b>Undefined Jinja2 variables</b> now cause an abort.</li>

		<li> <b>Set Jinja2 variables on the run command line</b>
		(in-line or by referencing an external file).</li>

		<li> <b>Removed pseudo backward compatibility</b>
		(<code>#!cylc-x.y.z</code>).  We will endeavor
		to provide proper backward compatibility from now on.</li>

		<li> Configurable <b>task messaging retry</b> for resilience to
		network outages etc.</li>
		
		<li> <b>Task messaging failure</b> no longer causes tasks to abort.</li>

		<li> <b>ssh task messaging</b>: the path to cylc on the suite host
		is now transferred via the task job script (no need to rely on 
		login scripts).</li>

		<li> A new <b>task retry event hook</b> is triggered if a task fails
		but has a retry lined up. The <b>task failed event hook</b> is only
		triggered on a final definitive failure.</li>

		<li> Handling <b>HPC job preemption:</b> Tasks can be configured 
		to revive from the dead if they start running again after reporting
		failure.</li>

		<li> A new config item to <b>abort a suite if any task fails</b>.</li>

		<li> Removed the requirement to prefix the integer TAG of an
		asynchronous (non-cycling) task, on the command line, with <b>a:</b>.</li>

		<li> Added <b>suite event hooks</b> for suite <b>startup</b> and
		<b>shutdown</b>.</li>

		<li> Replaced the original <b>simulation mode</b> which submitted
		real dummy tasks to run locally with a proper <b>simulation mode</b>
		that does not even submit dummy tasks, and a <b>dummy mode</b>
		that simply dummies out command scripting but leaves job
		submission, hosting, etc. intact.</li>

		<li> Tasks can check <b>$CYLC_TASK_IS_COLDSTART</b> to determine
		whether or not they are cold-start tasks.</li>

		<li> A new <b>strict validation</b> option protects against
		inadvertent creation of naked dummy tasks (tasks with no explicit
		runtime config) by misspelling task names.</li>

		<li> Optional <b>suite host identification by IP address</b> instead
		of host name.</li>

		<li> A suite-specific <b>sqlite database</b> is populated by
		cylc with task event and status information. Planned future uses
		include retrieval of information about long-finished tasks, and
		replacing the current primitive state dump files.</li>

		<li> Allow <b>(number-of-retries)*(delay)</b> notation in task
		<b>task retry</b> configuration.</li>

		<li> The <b>cylc doc</b> command now loads a documentation index in
		your browser.</li>

		<li> Suite <b>block/unblock</b> functionality has been removed.</li>

		<li> Optionally <b>disable use of a login shell</b> in
		passwordless ssh remote command invocation (e.g. to submit
		remote tasks). </li>

		<li> The task execution environment variables
		<b>$CYLC_SUITE_INITIAL_CYCLE_TIME</b> and
		<b>$CYLC_SUITE_FINAL_CYCLE_TIME</b> now persist across restarts.</li>

</ul>
