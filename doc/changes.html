<p><b>This document summarizes changes between cylc versions.</b>
Minor changes and bug fixes, and routine updates to the user guide may
be omitted. The definitive guide to changes is the repository commit log.<p>

<a name="5.3.0"/>
		<h2>5.3.0</h2>

		<ul>
				<li>New <code>submit</code> and <code>submit-fail</code> task
				triggers.</li>

				<li>The EVENT argument passed to event handler scripts now
				matches the suite.rc item names exactly (no replacement of
				spaces with underscores, e.g. in "submission timeout".</li>

				<li>Automatic polling as a task communication mechanism for task
				hosts that do not allow return messaging by network socket
				(Pyro) or ssh.</li>

				<li>On-demand job poll and kill by CLI and GUI.</li>

				<li>Automatic job poll on task job submission and execution
				timeouts.</li>

				<li>Automatic job polling on restarting a suite, to find out
				what happened to any orphaned tasks while the suite was
				down.</li> 

				<li>Fixed ksh compatibility in task job scripts.</li>

				<li>All gcylc views start in family-grouped mode.</li>

				<li>Optionally ignore suicide triggers in suite graphs and 
				the gcylc graph view.</li>

				<li>Delay between job submission batches set to zero by default.</li>

				<li>Option to kill active tasks before shutdown.</li>

				<li>Support for "future triggers": <code>foo[T+24] => bar</code></li>

				<li>Better spent task proxy clean-up algorithm.</li>

				<li>Allow manual triggering of tasks that are retrying.</li>

		</ul>

<a name="5.2.0"/>
		<h2>5.2.0</h2>

		<ul>
				<li><b>gcylc can now switch between suites</b> - the 
				former <code>cylc dbviewer</code> GUI has been converted to a
				"File Open" dialog for gcylc.</li>

				<li><b>Preparation commands</b> (validate, graph, etc.) can now take
						a suite definition path instead of a registered suite name.</li>

    		<li><b>Control commands</b> can now operate on multiple tasks at once,
				selecting by family name or regular expression.</li>

				<li><b>A new task state</b> to distinguish submission failure from 
						execution failure.</li>

				<li> Configurable <b>job submission retry</b>.</li>

				<li>A poll-and-wait option for the <b>stop command</b>.</li>

				<li><b>Orphaned running tasks</b> can now reconnect to a
				restarted suite, even if it starts on a different port.</li>

				<li>Automatic suite <b>run-directory housekeeping</b>.</li>

				<li>The final path component of a <b>task work directory</b> can
				now be set in the suite definition. This restores the pre cylc-5
				ability to allow groups of interdependent tasks that all read
				and write from their current working directories to be given a
				common file share space.</li>

				<li>The ssh connection now remains open while <b>remote background
						tasks</b> run, for sites that automatically kill detached
				processes on login nodes.</li>

				<li>Restored <b>dynamic host selection by environment variable</b>.</li>

				<li><b>Suicide triggers</b> can now be applied to task families.</li>

				<li>Interactive <b>command prompts</b> have been disabled by default.</li>

				<li>Dropped support for <b>Python 2.4.</b></li>

				<li><b>UTC mode</b> now sets <code>$TZ</code> in task environments.</li>

				<li>The <b>test battery</b> now cleans up temporary files after
				itself, and it has been parallelized.</li>

				<li> <b>syntax hilighting</b> for the <b>kate</b> editor.</li>

				<li>Access to the new <b>suite run-db</b> is now retried several
				times in case of an unlikely access conflict.</li>

				<li>A first-parent namespace can now be demoted to prevent its
				use as the visualization family (e.g. 
				<code>inherit = None, myparent</code> will keep the namespace 
				under root for visualization purposes).</li>

				<li><code>cylc list</code> command output has been updated
				for multiple inheritance, and the option to print namespace
				(task and family) title information has been restored.</li>

				<li>Cylc can now be invoked via symlinked directories in
				<code>$PATH</code>.</li>

		</ul>

<a name="5.1.1"/>
		<h2>5.1.1</h2>

		<ul>
				<li>Restored use of visualization settings, broken by
				the task ID delimiter change in 5.0.0.</li>

				<li>Restored <b>image file output</b> capability to the gcylc
				suite graph dialog.</li>
		</ul>

<a name="5.1.0"/>
		<h2>5.1.0</h2>

<ul>

		<li>Added <b>site/user config file documentation</b> to the User
		Guide.</li>

		<li>The <b>task ID delimiter has changed</b> from '%' to '.'
		(foo%2013080800 becomes foo.2013080800) because the '%' character
		causes trouble for web-based suite output viewers. This affects task
		IDs on the command line, and task log filenames, but it does not affect
		 suite definitions.</li>

		<li> Updated several example suites that were not validiting after recent changes.</li>

		<li><b>Multiple inheritance</b> for the runtime namespace hierarchy.</li>

		<li><b>A new command</b> <code>cylc [util] suite-state</code> queries the
		new suite run databases for task state, and in a polling mode can be
		used by tasks to wait on tasks in other suites.</li>

		<li>New <b>task job status files</b> in the task job log directory
		are updated by running tasks. In the future this will allow cylc to
		determine, on restarting, what happened to running tasks that were
		orphaned when the suite was down.</li>
</ul>


<a name="5.0.3"/>
		<h2>5.0.3</h2>

<ul>
		<li><b>Create many fewer temporary directories.</b></li>
</ul>

<a name="5.0.2"/>
		<h2>5.0.2</h2>

<ul>
		<li> <b>Bug fix for warm starts</b> - a function <code>plog()</code>
		that no longer exists was called on warm starting.</li>

		<li> <b>Bug fixes for doc/Makefile:</b> - "make clean" was not
		working, and a fatal error occured if htlatex was not installed.</li>

</ul>


<a name="5.0.1"/>
		<h2>5.0.1</h2>

<ul>
		<li> <b>Bug fix for 5.0.0 batched job submission:</b> a job
		submission failure would cause cylc to abort.</li>

		<li> <b>Changed "log root" filenames</b> (i.e. task job script plus
		stdout and stderr logs, and <code>$CYLC_TASK_LOG_ROOT</code>
		in task environments): replaced seconds-since-epoch with a simple
		<i>submit number</i> that increments on retries and manual
		triggering.</li>

		<li> Added a suite definition <b>syntax file</b> for the
		<b>gedit</b> editor and other gtksourceview programs:
		<code>conf/cylc.lang</code>.</li>

</ul>

<a name="5.0.0"/>
<h2>5.0.0</h2>

<ul>
		<li> <b>Multi-threading</b>: cylc now does continous request
		handling, batched task job submission, and batched event handler
		execution, in background threads. This has big performance
		benefits for large, busy, suites.</li>

		<li> Cylc now runs in <b>daemon mode</b> - no need to use nohup
		anymore.</li>

		<li> <b>Major change in suite restart behavior</b>: tasks recorded
		in the submitted, running, or failed states are no longer triggered
		automatically on restarting, because that is not always desirable.</li>

		<li> A new command can <b>broadcast runtime settings to tasks in
		a running suite</b>, overriding their configured settings. One way to
		use this: <b>tasks can communicate environment variables to other
				tasks downstream of them</b>.  Broadcast settings persist across
		restarts.</li> 

		<li> <b>Reloading the suite definition at run time</b> is now
		supported. Even task definitions can be added and removed without
		stopping and restarting the suite.</li>

		<li> <b>Restarting after deleting task definitions</b> now works 
		without modifying the state dump.</li>

		<li> <b>Dynamic host selection</b> is officially supported.</li>

		<li> New <b>family trigger syntax</b> allows any family finish
		semantics, with use of conditional operators.</li>

		<li> Higher level <b>family triggers</b> (families of
		families) can now be used in the graph.</li>

		<li> New <b>site and user config files</b> some former suite
		definition items, and other global settings, can now be configured 
		globally.</li> 

		<li> The <b>runahead limit</b> now automatically defaults to the
		twice the smallest cycling interval in a suite, and setting it too
		low can no longer stall a suite.</li>

		<li> <b>Self-diagnosing test suites</b> can now be created to test
		that cylc upgrades will not break your systems; see
		"Reference Tests" in the User Guide.</li> 

		<li> The <b>suite control GUI "gcontrol" has been renamed
				"gcylc"</b> as it now has suite preparation capability too
		(editing, graphing, validating, etc.); the former "gcylc" GUI is
		still available as <code>cylc dbviewer</code>.</li>

		<li> Configurable <b>gcylc task state color themes</b> common to all
		views.</li>

		<li> The <b>gcylc dot view</b> now has hover-over task state
		information, and right-click menus.</li>

		<li> The <b>gcylc graph view</b> now has:
		<ul>
				<li> <b>family node</b> state coloring and mouse-hover member
				state information</li>
				<li> <b>landscape mode</b></li>
				<li> <b>reduced redraw</b> (i.e. the graph jumps around less)</li>
				<li> <b>"cycle time focus"</b> now works (broken between 4.2.2 and 4.5.1)</li>
		</ul>
		</li>

		<li> <b>gcylc: less frequent polling</b> for stopped suites, to
		reduce network traffic. A polling reset button can be used to
		reconnect to a restarted suite immediately.</li>

		<li> <b>Undefined Jinja2 variables</b> now cause an abort.</li>

		<li> <b>Set Jinja2 variables on the run command line</b>
		(in-line or by referencing an external file).</li>

		<li> <b>Removed pseudo backward compatibility</b>
		(<code>#!cylc-x.y.z</code>).  We will endeavor
		to provide proper backward compatibility from now on.</li>

		<li> Configurable <b>task messaging retry</b> for resilience to
		network outages etc.</li>
		
		<li> <b>Task messaging failure</b> no longer causes tasks to abort.</li>

		<li> <b>ssh task messaging</b>: the path to cylc on the suite host
		is now transferred via the task job script (no need to rely on 
		login scripts).</li>

		<li> A new <b>task retry event hook</b> is triggered if a task fails
		but has a retry lined up. The <b>task failed event hook</b> is only
		triggered on a final definitive failure.</li>

		<li> Handling <b>HPC job preemption:</b> Tasks can be configured 
		to revive from the dead if they start running again after reporting
		failure.</li>

		<li> A new config item to <b>abort a suite if any task fails</b>.</li>

		<li> Removed the requirement to prefix the integer TAG of an
		asynchronous (non-cycling) task, on the command line, with <b>a:</b>.</li>

		<li> Added <b>suite event hooks</b> for suite <b>startup</b> and
		<b>shutdown</b>.</li>

		<li> Replaced the original <b>simulation mode</b> which submitted
		real dummy tasks to run locally with a proper <b>simulation mode</b>
		that does not even submit dummy tasks, and a <b>dummy mode</b>
		that simply dummies out command scripting but leaves job
		submission, hosting, etc. intact.</li>

		<li> Tasks can check <b>$CYLC_TASK_IS_COLDSTART</b> to determine
		whether or not they are cold-start tasks.</li>

		<li> A new <b>strict validation</b> option protects against
		inadvertent creation of naked dummy tasks (tasks with no explicit
		runtime config) by misspelling task names.</li>

		<li> Optional <b>suite host identification by IP address</b> instead
		of host name.</li>

		<li> A suite-specific <b>sqlite database</b> is populated by
		cylc with task event and status information. Planned future uses
		include retrieval of information about long-finished tasks, and
		replacing the current primitive state dump files.</li>

		<li> Allow <b>(number-of-retries)*(delay)</b> notation in task
		<b>task retry</b> configuration.</li>

		<li> The <b>cylc doc</b> command now loads a documentation index in
		your browser.</li>

		<li> Suite <b>block/unblock</b> functionality has been removed.</li>

		<li> Optionally <b>disable use of a login shell</b> in
		passwordless ssh remote command invocation (e.g. to submit
		remote tasks). </li>

		<li> The task execution environment variables
		<b>$CYLC_SUITE_INITIAL_CYCLE_TIME</b> and
		<b>$CYLC_SUITE_FINAL_CYCLE_TIME</b> now persist across restarts.</li>

</ul>
