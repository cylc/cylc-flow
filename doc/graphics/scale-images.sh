# The images in png/scaled/ are used in the html user guide; they are
# created by scaling the originals in png/orig/, and may need to be
# re-scaled if we ever change the html user guide page width.

# The scaled images are now version controlled rather than treated as a
# derived product, because they have to be stored in the gh-pages branch
# for the online documentation, and re-creating them seems to result in 
# "different" binary files each time.
