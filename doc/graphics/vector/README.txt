The SVG diagrams were created in Inkscape. 

The eps files are derived from the SVG files, but by manual "Save As" in
Inkscape on each SVG diagram, which is a pain in the ass. So in lieu of 
automatic generation from the SVG originals I'm adding both SVG and eps
to the repository.  

PDF files, if needed, can be generated on-the-fly from the eps files.
