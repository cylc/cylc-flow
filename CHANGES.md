## __cylc-8.2.0 (<span actions:bind='release-date'>Released 2023-07-21</span>)__

### Breaking Changes

[#5600](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/5600) -
The `CYLC_TASK_DEPENDENCIES` environment variable will no longer be exported
in job environments if there are more than 50 dependencies. This avoids an
issue which could cause jobs to fail if this variable became too long.

### Enhancements

[#5992](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/5992) -
Before trying to reload the workflow definition, the scheduler will
now wait for preparing tasks to submit, and pause the workflow.
After successful reload the scheduler will unpause the workflow.

[#5605](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/5605) - Added `-z` shorthand
option for defining a list of strings:
- Before: `cylc command -s "X=['a', 'bc', 'd']"`
- After: `cylc command -z X=a,bc,d`.

[#5537](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/5537) - Allow parameters
in family names to be split, e.g. `<foo>FAM<bar>`.

[#5589](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/5589) - Move to workflow
directory during file parsing, to give the template processor access to
workflow files.

[#5405](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/5405) - Improve scan command
help, and add scheduler PID to the output.

[#5461](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/5461) - preserve colour
formatting when starting workflows in distributed mode using `run hosts`.

[#5291](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/5291) - re-implement old-style
clock triggers as wall_clock xtriggers.

[#5439](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/5439) - Small CLI short option chages:
Add the `-n` short option for `--workflow-name` to `cylc vip`; rename the `-n`
short option for `--no-detach` to `-N`; add `-r` as a short option for
`--run-name`.

[#5231](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/5231) - stay up for a timeout
period on restarting a completed workflow, to allow for manual triggering.

[#5549](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/5549),
[#5546](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/5546) -
Various enhancements to `cylc lint`:
* `cylc lint` will provide a non-zero return code if any issues are identified.
  This can be overridden using the new `--exit-zero` flag.
* Fix numbering of lint codes (n.b. lint codes should now be permenantly
  unchanging, but may have changed since Cylc 8.1.4, so `pyproject.toml` files
  may need updating).
* Check for suicide triggers in `.cylc` files.
* Check for `platform = $(rose host-select)`.
* Check for use of deprecated Cylc commands (and `rose suite-hook`).
* Check for zero prefixed Jinja2 integers.
* Only check for missing Jinja2 shebangs in `flow.cylc` and
  `suite.rc` files.


[#5525](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/5525) - Jobs can use scripts
in `share/bin` and Python modules in `share/lib/python`.

list and view workflow log files including install logs and workflow

causing Cylc to be unable to parse previously played Cylc 7 workflows.

[#5312](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/5312) - task names must be

environment variable `$CYLC_WORKFLOW_NAME_BASE` as the basename of

uses of a configured text editor (via `cylc view` and `cylc cat-log` options).

already been removed from Cylc 8.

Autospawn absolute-triggered tasks exactly the same way as parentless tasks.

[#4984](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4984) -
Fixes an issue with `cylc reload` which could cause preparing tasks to become
stuck.

- Fix delayed spawning of parentless tasks that do have parents in a previous
  cycle point.
- Make integer-interval runahead limits consistent with time-interval limits:
  `P0` means just the runahead base point; `P1` the base point and the point
  (i.e. one cycle interval), and so on.

[#4936](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4936) - Fix incorrect
error messages when workflow CLI commands fail.

now fails if
[owner setting](https://cylc.github.io/cylc-doc/stable/html/reference/config/workflow.html#flow.cylc[runtime][%3Cnamespace%3E][remote]owner)
is used, as that setting no longer has any effect.

[#4978](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4978) - `cylc clean`: fix
occasional failure to clean on remote hosts due to leftover contact file.

[#4889](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4889) - `cylc clean`: don't
prompt if no matching workflows.

[#4890](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4890) - `cylc install`: don't
overwrite symlink dir targets if they were not cleaned properly before.

[#4881](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4881) - Fix bug where commands
targeting a specific cycle point would not work if using an abbreviated
cycle point format.
