- Fix delayed spawning of parentless tasks that do have parents in a previous
  cycle point.
- Make integer-interval runahead limits consistent with time-interval limits:
  `P0` means just the runahead base point; `P1` the base point and the point
  (i.e. one cycle interval), and so on.

[#4936](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4936) - Fix incorrect
error messages when workflow CLI commands fail.

now fails if
[owner setting](https://cylc.github.io/cylc-doc/latest/html/reference/config/workflow.html#flow.cylc[runtime][%3Cnamespace%3E][remote]owner)
is used, as that setting no longer has any effect.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## __cylc-8.0rc3 (<span actions:bind='release-date'>Released 2022-05-19</span>)__

Third Release Candidate for Cylc 8 suitable for acceptance testing.

### Enhancements

[#4738](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4738) and
[#4739](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4739) - Implement `cylc trigger
[--flow=] [--wait]` for manual triggering with respect to active flows (the
default), specific flows, new flows, or one-off task runs. This replaces
the `--reflow` option from earlier pre-release versions.

[#4743](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4743) - On stopping a specific
flow, remove active-waiting tasks with no remaining flow numbers.

[#4854](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4854)
- Expansion and merger of comma separated platform definitions permitted.
- Platform definition regular expressions which match "localhost" but are not
  "localhost" are now explicitly forbidden and will raise an exception.

[#4842](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4842) -
Improve Jinja2 error reporting when the error is behind an `{% include`.

[#4861](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4861) - Allow workflow source
 directories to be under `cylc-run`.

[#4828](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4828) - scan CLI: corrupt
workflow contact files should result in a warning, not a crash.

[#4823](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4823) - Remove the `--directory`
option for `cylc install` (the functionality has been merged into the
workflow source argument), and rename the `--flow-name` option to
`--workflow-name`.

### Fixes

[#4873](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4873) - `cylc show`: don't
show prerequisites of past tasks recalled from the DB as unsatisfied.

[#4875](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4864) - Fix the file name
pattern matching used for emacs syntax highlighting.

[#4864](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4864) - Allow strings
and more complex data type template variables to be stored correctly
in the workflow database.

[#4863](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4863) - Execution timeout is no
longer set based on execution time limit. Fixes bug where execution timeout
would get overridden.

[#4844](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4844) - Fixes bug where
execution polling intervals used in combination with an execution time limit
resulted in incorrect polling intervals.

[#4829](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4829) -
Suppress deprecated configuration warnings in Cylc 7 compatibility mode.

[#4830](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4830) -

implementation of the ISO 8601 recurrence format no. 1
(`R<number>/<start-point>/<second-point>`)
(see [metomi/isodatetime#45](https://github.com/metomi/isodatetime/issues/45)).
This recurrence format was not mentioned in the Cylc documentation, so
this is unlikely to affect you.

[#4748](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4748) -
`cylc tui` gives a more helpful error message when a workflow is not running;
distinguishing between workflow not running and not in run-directory.

[#4797](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4797) -
`cylc reload` now triggers a fresh remote file installation for all relevant
platforms, any files configured to be installed will be updated on the remote
platform.

(e.g. typo) in the config.

[#4827](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4827) - Fix bug where specifying
an invalid `--stopcp` would corrupt the workflow database. Also fix
inconsistency between how `[scheduling]stop after cycle point` was handled
on reload/restart compared to the other cycle point settings.

`cylc clean <workflow_name>/runN` from working.

[#4769](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4769) - Fix handling of quoted
command args for invocation on remote run hosts.

Remove obsolete Cylc 7 `[scheduling]spawn to max active cycle points` config.

[#4319](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4319) -
Update cylc reinstall to skip cylc dirs work and share

[#4289](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4289) - Make `cylc clean`

when initial cycle point is not valid for the cycling type.

[#4228](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4228) - Interacting with a
workflow on the cli using `runN` is now supported.

[#4193](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4193) - Standard `cylc install`
now correctly installs from directories with a `.` in the name. Symlink dirs
now correctly expands environment variables on the remote. Fixes minor cosmetic
bugs.

[#4199](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4199) -
`cylc validate` and `cylc run` now check task/family names in the `[runtime]`
section for validity.

[#4180](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4180) - Fix bug where installing
a workflow that uses the deprecated `suite.rc` filename would symlink `flow.cylc`
to the `suite.rc` in the source dir instead of the run dir. Also fixes a couple
of other, small bugs.

[#4188](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4188) - Fix incorrect usage
examples for `cylc install`.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## __cylc-8.0b0 (<span actions:bind='release-date'>Released 2021-03-29</span>)__

First beta release of Cylc 8.

(See note on cylc-8 backward-incompatible changes, above)

The filenames `suite.rc` and `global.rc` are now deprecated in favour of
`flow.cylc` and `global.cylc` respectively
([#3755](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3755)). For backward
compatibility, the `cylc run` command will automatically symlink an existing
`suite.rc` file to `flow.cylc`.

Obsolete *queued* task state replaced by *waiting*, with a queued flag;
queueing logic centralized.
([#4088](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4088)).

`cylc register` has been replaced by `cylc install`
([#4000](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4000)).

Added a new command: `cylc clean`, for removing stopped workflows on the local
and any remote filesystems ([#3961](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3961),
[#4017](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4017)).

`cylc run` and `cylc restart` have been replaced by `cylc play`, simplifying
how workflows are restarted
([#4040](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4040)).

`cylc pause` and `cylc play` are now used to pause and resume workflows,
respectively. `cylc hold` and `cylc release` now only hold and release tasks,
not the whole workflow. ([#4076](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4076))

"Implicit"/"naked" tasks (tasks that do not have an explicit definition in
`flow.cylc[runtime]`) are now disallowed by default
([#4109](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4109)). You can allow them by
setting `flow.cylc[scheduler]allow implicit tasks` to `True`.

Named checkpoints have been removed ([#3906](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3906))
due to being a seldom-used feature. Workflows can still be restarted from the
last run, or reflow can be used to achieve the same result.

### Enhancements

[#4119](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4119) - Reimplement ssh task
communications.

[#4115](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4115) - Raise an error when
invalid sort keys are provided clients.

[#4105](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4105) - Replace the
`cylc executable` global config setting with `cylc path`, for consistency with
`cylc` invocation in job scripts.

[#4014](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4014) - Rename "ready" task
state to "preparing".

[#4000](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4000) - `cylc install` command
added. Install workflows into cylc run directory from source directories
configured in `global.cylc` (see [#4132](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4132)),
or from arbitrary locations.

[#4071](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4071) - `cylc reinstall` command
added.

[#3992](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3992) - Rename
batch system to job runner.

[#3791](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3791) - Support Slurm
heterogeneous jobs with a special directive prefix.

[#3974](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3974) - Template variables,
both in set files and provided via the -s/--set command line options are
now parsed using ast.literal_eval. This permits non-string data types,
strings must now be quoted.

[#3811](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3811) - Move from cycle based
to `n` distance dependency graph window node generation and pruning of the
data-store (API/visual backing data). Ability to modify distance of live
workflow via API, with default of `n=1`.

[#3899](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3899) - CLI changes
* Commands no longer re-invoke (so you get `cylc run` not `cylc-run`).
* Improve CLI descriptions and help.
* Internal-only commands now hidden from help.
* New entry point for defining Cylc sub-commands.
* remove `cylc check-software` (use standard tools like pipdeptree)
* remove `cylc nudge` (no longer needed)

[#3884](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3884) - Directories `run`,
`log`, `share`, `share/cycle`, `work` now have the option to be redirected to
configured directories by symlink.

[#3856](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3856) - fail the GraphQL query
with a helpful message if the variables defined do not match the expected
values.

[#3853](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3853) - Update protobuf and
pyzmq.

[#3857](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3857) - removed the obsolete
"runahead" task state (not used since spawn-on-demand implementation).

[#3816](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3816) - change `cylc spawn`
command name to `cylc set-outputs` to better reflect its role in Cylc 8.

[#3796](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3796) - Remote installation is
now on a per install target rather than a per platform basis. `app/`, `bin/`,
`etc/`, `lib/` directories are now installed on the target, configurable in flow.cylc.

[#3724](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3724) - Re-implemented
the `cylc scan` command line interface and added a Python API for accessing
workflow scanning functionality.

[#3515](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3515) - spawn-on-demand: a more
efficient way of the evolving the workflow via the graph.

[#3692](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3692) - Use the `$EDITOR`
and `$GEDITOR` environment variables to determine the default editor to use.

[#3574](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3574) - use the bash
installation defined in $path rather than hardcoding to /bin/bash.

[#3774](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3774) - Removed support for
interactive prompt.

[#3798](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3798) - Deprecated the
`[runtime][X][parameter environment templates]` section and instead allow
templates in `[runtime][X][environment]`.

[#3802](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3802) - New global config
hierarchy and ability to set site config directory.

[#3848](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3848) - Deprecated
`[scheduling]max active cycle points` in favour of `[scheduling]runahead limit`.

[#3883](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3883) - Added a new workflow
config option `[scheduling]stop after cycle point`.

[#3913](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3913) - Added the ability to
use plugins to parse suite templating variables and additional files to
install. Only one such plugin exists at the time of writing, designed to
parse ``rose-suite.conf`` files in repository "cylc-rose".

[#3955](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3955) - Global config options
to control the job submission environment.

[#4020](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4020) - `cylc validate` will no
longer check for a cyclic/circular graph if there are more than 100 tasks,
unless the option  `--check-circular` is used. This is to improve performance.

[#3913](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3913) - Add ability to use
pre-install entry point from cylc-rose plugin to provide environment and
template variables for a workflow.

[#4023](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4023) - Add ability to use
post-install entry point from cylc-rose to use Rose style CLI settings of
configurations in Cylc install. If Cylc-rose is installed three new CLI
options will be available:
- `--opt_conf_keys="foo, bar"`
- `--defines="[env]FOO=BAR"`
- `--suite-defines="FOO=BAR"`

[#4101](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4101) - Add the ability to
ignore (clear) rose install options from an earlier install:
`cylc reinstall --clear-rose-install-options`

[#4094](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4094) - Prevent Cylc from
rsyncing the following files on install and reinstall:
- `rose-suite.conf`
- `opt/rose-suite-cylc-install.conf`
These files should be handled by the cylc-rose plugin if you require them.

[#4126](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4126) - Make obsolete the config
``flow.cylc:[runtime][__TASK__][remote]suite definition directory``.

[#4098](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4098) - Provide a dictionary called
CYLC_TEMPLATE_VARS into the templating environment.

[#4099](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4099) - Unify `cylc get-suite-config`
and `cylc get-site-config` commands as `cylc config`. Some options have been
removed.

### Fixes

[#3984](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3984) - Only write task
event timers to the database when they have changed (reverts behaviour
change in 7.8.6). This corrects last updated db entries and reduces filesystem
load.

[#3917](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3917) - Fix a bug that caused
one of the hostname resolution tests to fail in certain environments.

[#3879](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3879) - Removed Google
Groups e-mail from pip packaging metadata. Users browsing PYPI will have
to visit our website to find out how to reach us (we are using Discourse
and it does not offer an e-mail address).

[#3859](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3859) - Fixes the query of
broadcast states to retrieve only the data for the requested ID, instead
of returning all the broadcast states in the database.

[#3815](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3815) - Fixes a minor bug in the
auto-restart functionality which caused suites to wait for local jobs running
on *any* host to complete before restarting.

[#3732](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3732) - XTrigger labels
are now validated to ensure that runtime errors can not occur when
exporting environment variables.

[#3632](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3632) - Fix a bug that was causing
`UTC mode` specified in global config to be pretty much ignored.

[#3614](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3614) - Ensure the suite always
restarts using the same time zone as the last `cylc run`.

[#3788](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3788),
[#3820](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3820) - Task messages and
task outputs/message triggers are now validated.

[#3614](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3795) - Fix error when running
`cylc ping --verbose $SUITE`.

[#3852](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3852) - Prevents registering a
workflow in a sub-directory of a run directory (as `cylc scan` would not be
able to find it).

[#3452](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3452) - Fix param graph
issue when mixing offset and conditional (e.g. foo<m-1> & baz => foo<m>).

[#3982](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3982) - Fix bug preventing
workflow from shutting down properly on a keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C) in
Python 3.8+.

[#4011](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4011) - Fix bug where including
a trailing slash in the suite/workflow name would cause `cylc stop`
(and possibly other commands) to silently fail.

[#4046](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4046) - Fix bug where a workflow
database could still be active for a short time after the workflow stops.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## __cylc-8.0a2 (2020-07-03)__

Third alpha release of Cylc 8.

(See note on cylc-8 backward-incompatible changes, above)

The commands `cylc submit` and `cylc jobscript` have been removed.

### Enhancements

[#3389](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3389) - Publisher/Subscriber
network components added (0MQ PUB/SUB pattern). Used to publish fine-grained
data-store updates for the purposes of UI Server data sync, this change also
includes CLI utility: `cylc subscribe`.

[#3402](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3402) - removed automatic task
job status message retries (problems that prevent message transmission are
almost never transient, and in practice job polling is the only way to
recover).

[#3463](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3463) - cylc tui:
A new terminal user interface to replace the old `cylc monitor`.
An interactive collapsible tree to match the new web interface.

files are now auto-documented from their definitions.

[#3617](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3617) - For integer cycling mode
there is now a default initial cycle point of 1.

[#3423](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3423) - automatic task retries
re-implemented using xtriggers. Retrying tasks will now be in the "waiting"
state with a wall_clock xtrigger set for the retry time.

### Fixes

[#3618](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3618) - Clear queue configuration
warnings for referencing undefined or unused tasks.

[#3596](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3596) - Fix a bug that could
prevent housekeeping of the task_action_timers DB table and cause many warnings
at restart.

[#3602](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3602) - Fix a bug that prevented
cycle point format conversion by the `cylc suite-state` command and the
`suite_state` xtrigger function, if the target suite used the default format
but downstream command or suite did not.

[#3541](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3541) - Don't warn that a task
was already added to an internal queue, if the queue is the same.

[#3409](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3409) - prevent cylc-run from
creating directories when executed for suites that do not exist.

[#3433](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3433) - fix server abort at
shutdown during remote run dir tidy (introduced during Cylc 8 development).

[#3493](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3493) - Update jinja2 and
pyzmq, as well as some test/dev dependencies. Fixes Jinja2 error where
validation shows incorrect context.

[#3531](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3531) - Fix job submission to
SLURM when task name has a percent `%` character.

[#3543](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3543) - fixed pipe polling
issue observed on darwin (BSD) which could cause Cylc to hang.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## __cylc-8.0a1 (2019-09-18)__

Second alpha release of Cylc 8.

(See note on cylc-8 backward-incompatible changes, above)

### Enhancements

[#3377](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3377) - removed support for
sourcing `job-init-env.sh` in task job scripts. Use bash login scripts instead.

[#3302](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3302) - improve CLI

README badges, setup.py, and a few more places.

[#3138](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3138) - add suite aborted
event.

[#3132](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3132) - move parsec to
cylc.parsec.

[#3113](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3113) - document

[#3272](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3272),
[#3191](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3191) - uniform configuration
section level for defining non-cycling and cycling graphs. E.g.:

```
# Deprecated Syntax
[scheduling]
    initial cycle point = next(T00)
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[P1D]]]
            graph = task1 => task2
```

Can now be written as:

```
# New Syntax
[scheduling]
    initial cycle point = next(T00)
    [[graph]]
        P1D = task1 => task2
```

[#3249](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3249) - export the environment
variable `ISODATETIMEREF` (reference time for the `isodatetime` command from
[metomi-isodatetime](https://github.com/metomi/isodatetime/)) in task jobs to
have the same value as `CYLC_TASK_CYCLE_POINT`.

[#3286](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3286) -
Removed the `cylc check-triggering` command.
Changed the `suite.rc` schema:
* Removed `[cylc]log resolved dependencies`
* Removed `[cylc][[reference test]]*` except `expected task failures`.
* Moved `[cylc]abort if any task fails` to
  `[cylc][[events]]abort if any task fails` so it lives with the other
  `abort if/on ...` settings.

[#3351](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3351) - sped up suite validation
(which also affects responsiveness of suite controllers during suite startup,
restarts, and reloads).  Impact of the speedup is most noticeable when dealing
with suite configurations that contain tasks with many task outputs.

[#3358](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3358) - on submitting jobs to
SLURM or LSF, the job names will now follow the pattern `task.cycle.suite`
(instead of `suite.task.cycle`), for consistency with jobs on PBS.

[#3356](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3356) - default job name length
maximum for PBS is now 236 characters (i.e. assuming PBS 13 or newer). If you
are still using PBS 12 or older, you should add a site configuration to
restrict it to 15 characters.

### Fixes

[#3308](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3308) - fix a long-standing bug
causing suites to stall some time after reloading a suite definition that
removed tasks from the graph.

[#3287](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3287) - fix xtrigger
cycle-sequence specificity.

[#3258](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3258) - leave '%'-escaped string
templates alone in xtrigger arguments.

[#3010](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3010) - fixes except KeyError
in task_job_mgr.

[#3173](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/issues/3173) - NameError when
invalid cylc command is used (instead of a ValueError).

[#3003](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3003) - Fix inheritance
with quotes using shlex.

[#3184](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3184) - Fix restart
correctness when the suite has a hold point, stop point, a stop task, a stop
clock time and/or an auto stop option. These settings are now stored in the
suite run SQLite file and are retrieved on suite restart. In addition, the
settings are removed when they are consumed, e.g. if the suite stopped
previously on reaching the stop point, the stop point would be consumed, so
that on restart the suite would not stop again immediately.

The `cylc run` command can now accept `--initial-cycle-point=CYCLE-POINT`
(`--icp=CYCLE-POINT)` and `--start-cycle-point=CYCLE-POINT` options. This
change should allow the command to have  a more uniform interface with commands
such as `cylc validate`, and with the final/stop cycle point options).

After this change:
* `cylc run SUITE POINT` is equivalent to `cylc run --icp=POINT SUITE`.
* `cylc run -w SUITE POINT` is equivalent to
  `cylc run -w --start-point=POINT SUITE`.

The `cylc run` and `cylc restart` commands can now accept the
`--final-cycle-point=POINT` and `--stop-cycle-point=POINT` options. The
`--until=POINT` option is now an alias for `--final-cycle-point=POINT` option.

The `cylc run` and `cylc restart` commands can now accept the new
`--auto-shutdown` option. This option overrides the equivalent suite
configuration to force auto shutdown to be enabled. Previously, it is only
possible to disable auto shutdown on the command line.

[#3236](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3236) - Fix submit number
increment logic on insert of family with tasks that were previously submitted.

[#3276](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3276) - Fix log & DB recording
of broadcasts from xtriggers so they register all settings, not just one.

[#3325](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3325) - Fix task event handler
*start_time* being unavailable in *started* events.
