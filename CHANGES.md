-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## __cylc-7.7.0 (2018-05-12)__

### Enhancements

[#2661](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2661) -
 * new User Guide section on Remote Job Management
 * tidy the installation documentation
 * standardise directory structures (all docs updated accordingly):
   - deprecated `<cylc-dir>conf/` file locations:
     - site config file `<cylc-dir>etc/global.rc`
     - gcylc config example `<cylc-dir>/etc/gcylc.rc.eg`
     - site job environment init `<cylc-dir/etc/job-init-env.sh`
     - editor syntax files in `<cylc-dir>etc/syntax/`
     - bash completion script `<cylc-dir>/etc/cylc-bash-completion`
   - user `global.rc` can now go in `~/.cylc/<cylc-version>/` or `~/.cylc/`
     (the version-specific location avoid forward compatibility problems - see
     notes in `<cylc-dir>/etc/global.rc.eg`).
   - moved central cylc wrapper template to `usr/bin/cylc`
   - various developer scripts and notes moved from `<cylc-dir>/dev/` to
     `<cylc-dir>/etc/dev-bin, dev-notes, dev-suites`.
   - *the ancient `site.rc` and `user.rc` global config filename variants are
     now obsolete.*

[#2659](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2659) - commands in the process pool
(event handlers, and job submit, poll and kill commands) will now be killed on
a configurable timeout if they hang, rather than tying up a member of the
finite process pool: `global.rc` default: `process pool timeout = PT10M`

[#2582](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2582) - improve client/server
interface, including: `cylc message` can send multiple messages at once, with
different severities; server ignores messages from superseded job submits;
running jobs detect that the suite has been cold-started under them and will
not attempt to connect; ssh-based indirect client-server communication now
works automatically for all clients, not just messaging.

[#2582](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2582), 
[#2624](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2624), and earlier changes: all job
host actions are now done by remote `cylc` subcommands that are compatible with
ssh whitelisting.

[#2590](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2590) - replaced the fixed process
pool with direct management of individual sub-processes (for external commands
executed by the server program).

[#2561](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2561) - pass resolved triggering
dependencies to `$CYLC_TASK_DEPENDENCIES` in job environments.

[#2639](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2639) - date-time cycling: document
availability of 365-day (never a leap year) and 366-day (always a leap year)
calendars.

[#2597](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2597) - emit a "late" event if a task
has not triggered by a user-defined real-time offset relative to cycle point. 

[#2648](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2648) - improve version reporting.
Note than non-standard lowercase `cylc -v` is now gone; use `cylc -V` or `cylc
--version`, with optional `--long` format to print as well as version.

[#2620](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2620) - re-document the long-dated
`[special tasks]sequential` and recommend using explicit dependencies in the
graph instead.

[#2584](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2584) - internal queues now release
task jobs on a FIFO (First In, First Out) basis, rather than randomly.

[#2538](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2538) - remove leading whitespace
from multi-line `script` items in task definitions, for cleaner job scripts.

[#2624](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2624),
[#2667](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2667),
[#2669](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2669), 
[#2672](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2672) - `cylc cat-log` (and GUI "View
Jobs Logs") rewrite for enhanced functionality (and fix: should no longer leave
orphaned `tail` processes on remote hosts).

### Fixes

[#2666](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2666) - `cylc scan`: make default
behavior consistent with `cylc gscan`: get suite information from `~/cylc-run/`
only for the current user; and no partial matches with `-n/--name=PATTERN`
(i.e. `--name=bar` will only match the suite `bar`, not `foobar` or `barbaz`).

[#2593](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2593) - fix polling after job
execution timeout (configured pre-poll delays were being ignored).

[#2656](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2656) - fix suicide triggers with
multiple prerequisites in the same graph line. 

[#2638](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2618) - fix duplicate "failed" task
events after `cylc stop --kill`.

[#2653](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2653) - tidy and correct the main `cylc
help` documentation.

[#2644](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2644), 
[#2646](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2646) - fix some graph parsing edge
cases.

[#2649](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2649) - respect suite
UTC mode when recording job submit time (database and GUI tree view).

[#2631](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2631) - fix "failed" task event after
bad host select.

[#2626](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2626) - `cylc gui`: fix error when
a task job completes just before "view task prerequisites" (menu) is actioned.

[#2600](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2600) - correct task prerequisite
manipulation on state changes.

[#2596](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2596) - fix reference to parameter
values containing `+` or `-` characters.

[#2592](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2592) - permit syntax errors in edit
runs, so that the job file still gets written.

[#2579](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2579) - `cylc gscan`: fix a
re-spawning error dialog.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## __cylc-7.6.1 (2018-03-28)__

A collection of bug fixes made since cylc-7.6.0.

### Fixes

[#2571](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2571) - `cylc gui`: fix tailing of
remote job logs from the GUI (in 7.6.0 this failed with a Python traceback).

[#2596](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2596) - allow parameter values that
contain +/- characters

[#2574](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2574) - `cylc gscan HOST`: show just
the owner's suites by default (at 7.6.0 this showed all suites on HOST).

[#2592](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2592) - `cylc trigger --edit`:
disable job script syntax checking in edit runs (this prevented a new job
script from being written for editing).

[#2579](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2579) - `cylc gscan`: fix respawning
error dialog on giving a bad regular expression (on the command line) to match
owner or suite name.

[#2606](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2606) - jobs with batch system info
missing in a corrupted status file (thus not pollable) will now poll as failed
rather appear stuck as running.

[#2603](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2603) - `cylc gui` (graph view): fix
possible error on inserting a nested family.

[#2602](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2602) - `cylc gui` (tree view): fix
negative progress bar value (reportedly possible after manual task state
manipulations).

[#2586](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2586) - `cylc gui` (tree view): fix
possible division-by-zero error in elapsed time computation.

[#2588](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2588) - `cylc trigger --edit`: fix
edit runs for tasks with dynamic remote host selection.

[#2585](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2585) - fix recovery from a failed
host select command.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## __cylc-7.6.0 (2018-02-07)__

### Enhancements

[#2373](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2373) - refactored suite server code
(for efficiency, maintainability, etc.)

[#2396](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2396) - improved job polling and task
state reset:
 * allow polling of finished tasks - to confirm they really succeeded or failed
 * poll to confirm a task message that implies a state reversal - it could just
   be a delayed message
 * allow reset to submitted or running states
 * removed the "enable resurrection" setting - any task can now return from the
   dead

[#2410](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2410) - new CUSTOM severity task
messages that can trigger a custom event handler

[#2420](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2420) - `cylc monitor` now
reconnects automatically if its target suite gets restarted on a different port

[#2430](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2430) - `cylc gscan`,
`cylc gui` - significant reduction in impact on suite server
programs

[#2433](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2433) - "group" (used to group suites
in `cylc gscan`) is now defined under the suite "[[meta]]" section

[#2424](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2424) - task job scripts now run in
`bash -l` (login shell) instead of explicitly sourcing your
`.profile` file. *WARNING*: if you have a
`.bash_profile` and were using `.profile` as well just for
Cylc, the latter file will now be ignored because bash gives precendence to the
former. If so, just move your Cylc settings into
`.bash_profile` or consult the Cylc User Guide for
other ways to configure the task job environment.

[#2441](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2441) -
[#2458](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2458) - allow more event handler
arguments:
 * batch system name and job ID
 * submit time, start time, finish time
 * user@host

[#2455](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2455) - network client improvements:
 * on a failed connection, clients detect if the suite has stopped according to
   the contact file, then report it stopped and remove the contact file
 * on attempt run an already-running suite (contact file exists) print more
   information on how old the suite is and how to shut it down
 * clients running in plain HTTP protocol will no longer attempt to fetch a
   non-existent SSL certificate
 * if a contact file is loaded, always use the values in it to avoid
   conflicting host strings in SSL certificate file, etc. 

[#2468](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2468) - initialize task remotes
asynchronously via the multiprocessing pool, to avoid holding up suite start-up
unnecessarily. *WARNING* this introduces new remote commands: `cylc
remote-init` and `cylc remote-tidy` that will affect sites
using ssh whitelisting

[#2449](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2449) -
[#2469](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2469) -

[#2552](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2552) -
[#2564](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2564) -
User Guide:
 * rewrote the section on restart from state checkpoints
 * rewrote the section on suite run databases
 * new section on suite contact files
 * new section on disaster recovery
 * new section on remote monitoring and control
 * improved terminology:
   * "suite server program" instead of "suite daemon" (it's not always a daemon)
   * "severity" instead of "priority" for logging and task messaging
   * "task remote" to encompass the concept of "the account where a task job
     runs" whether under the same user account or not, on another host or not
 * documented requirements for remote access to suite-parsing and
   file-retrieval commands, including via the GUI; and clarified the same for
   suite client commands
 * documented a known bug in use of parameters in complex graph syntax (and an
   easy workaround) - see the task parameters section
 * documented kill-to-hold behavior of tasks with retries configured

[#2475](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2475) - suite server program:
separate debug mode from daemonization

[#2485](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2485) - export task job environment
variables on definition and before assignment, to ensure they are available to
subshells immediately - even in expressions inside subsequent variable
definitions

[#2489](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2489) -
[#2557](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2557) - 
`cylc gscan` -

   * fix and document the "extra log files" setting
   * add "view in editor" support for extra log files
   * add text-editor functionality to `cylc jobscript`
   * add "preview jobscript" functionality to the GUI

[#2527](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2527) -
[#2431](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2431) - 
[#2435](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2435) - 
[#2445](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2445) - 
[#2491](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2491) - 
[#2484](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2484) - 
[#2556](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2556) - 
improved parameter support: 
 * allow "%d" integer format in parameter templates
 * allow out of range parameter on graph RHS
 * allow positive offset for parameter index on graph
 * allow negative integer parameters
 * allow custom templating of parameter environment variables, in addition to
   the built-in `CYLC_TASK_PARAM\_&lt;param-name&gt;`
 * allow bare parameter values as task names
 * allow explicit parameter values in "inherit" items under "[runtime]"
 * fix parameters inside (as opposed to beginning or end) of family names
 * fixed inheritance from multiple parameterized namespaces at once

[#2553](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2553) - upgraded the bundled Jinja2
version to 2.10. This fixes the block scope problem introduced in the previous
version

[#2558](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2558) - new options to print out JSON
format from `cylc show` and `cylc scan`

### Fixes

[#2381](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2381) - validation: fail bad event
handler argument templates

[#2416](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2416) - validation: print the problem
namespace in case of bad multiple inheritance

[#2426](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2426) - validation: fail
non-predefined config item names (e.g. batch scheduler directives) that contain
multiple consecutive spaces (to ensure that hard-to-spot whitespace typos don't
prevent repeated items from overriding as intended)

[#2432](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2432) - fixed an issue that could
cause HTTPS client failure due to SSL certificate host name mismatch

[#2434](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2434) - correctly strip "at TIME"
from the end of multi-line task messages

[#2440](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2440) - `cylc suite-state`
- fixed DB query of tasks with custom outputs that have not been generated yet

[#2444](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2444) - added `cylc
report-timings` to main command help

[#2449](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2449):
 * server suite and task URLs from suite server programs, rather than parsing
   them from the suite definition - so browsing URLs from a remote GUI now
   works
 * allow proper string templating of suite and task names in URLs; retained the
   old pseudo environment variables for backward compatibility

[#2461](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2461) - fixed manual task retrigger
after an aborted edit run - this was erroneously using the edited job file 

[#2462](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2462) - fixed job polling for the SGE
batch scheduler

[#2464](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2464) - fixed the ssh+HTTPS task
communication method (broken at cylc-7.5.0)

date-time subtraction (first\_point - last\_point)

[#2474](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2474) - `cylc graph` -
better handle suite parsing errors on view refresh

[#2496](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2496) - ensure that broadcasted
environment variables are defined before all user-defined variables, which may
need to reference the broadcasted ones 

[#2523](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2523) - fixed a problem with suicide
triggers: with several used at once, tasks could go untriggered

[#2546](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2546) - fixed problems with stop
point after a suite reload: do not reset an existing stop point (this is
dangerous, but it could be done before, and the stop point in the GUI status
bar would still refer to the original)

[#2562](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2562) - improved advice on how to
generate an initial user config file (`global.rc`)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[#2330](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2330): New suite.rc `[meta]` sections
for suite and task metadata. These hold the existing `title`, `description`,
and `URL` items, plus arbitrary user-defined items. Metadata items can be passed
to event handlers (e.g. a site-specific task "priority" or "importance" rating
could inform an event-handler's decision on whether or not to escalate task
failures).

[#2298](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2298),
[#2401](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2401): New shell function
`cylc__job_abort <message>` to abort task job scripts with a custom message
that can be passed to task failed event handlers.

[#2204](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2204): Remove auto-fallback to HTTP
communications, if HTTPS is not available.  Now HTTP is only used if explicitly
configured.

report-timings` to generate reports of task runtime statistics.

[#2304](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2304): New event handlers for general
CRITICAL events.

[#2244](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2244), 
[#2258](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2258): Advanced syntax for excluding
multiple points from cycling sequences.

[#2407](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2407): Documented exactly how Cylc
uses ssh, scp, and rsync to interact with remote job hosts.

[#2346](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2346), 
[#2386](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2386): `cylc graph` now plots
implicit dependences as grayed-out ghost nodes.

[#2343](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2343): Improved the "Running
Suites" section of the User Guide, including documentation of suite remote
control.

[#2344](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2344): Attempt to access suite
service files via the filesystem first, before ssh, for other accounts on the
suite host.

[#2360](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2360): Better validation of suite
parameter configuration.

[#2314](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2314): In debug mode, send bash job
script xtrace output (from `set -x`) to a separate log file.

### Fixes

[#2409](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2409): Fixed the `cylc spawn` command
(it was killing tasks, since cylc-7).

[#2378](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2378): Fixed use of negative offsets
by the `cylc suite-state` command.

[#2364](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2364): Correctly load completed custom

command line templates gracefully.

[#2308](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2308): The parameterized task
environment variable `$CYLC_TASK_PARAM_<param>` is now guaranteed to be defined 
before any use of it in the user-defined task environment section.

[#2296](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2296): Prevent suites stalling after
a restart that closely follows a warm-start (now the restart, like the warm
start, ignores dependence on tasks from before the warm start point).

[#2295](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2295): Fixed `cylc cat-log` "open in
editor" functionality for remote job logs.

[#2412](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2412): Fixed duplication of log
messages to the old log after restart.

syntax and features.**

[#2044](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2044): Suite start-up now aborts with
a sensible message on suite configuration errors (previously this happened post

files (passphrase, SSL files, contact file, etc.) under `.service/` in the
suite run directory; the suite registration database and port files under

now continued on restart.

### Other Changes

[#2042](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2042): Documented `[scheduling]spawn

cycling workflows and use of parameterized tasks as a proxy for cycling.

[#2021](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2021): `cylc gui`: removed the

should be obvious by the reconnection countdown timer in the info bar.

[#2023](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2023): New custom event email footer
via global or suite config.

[#2013](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2013): Fixed "remove task after
spawning" which since 6.9.0 would not force a waiting task to spawn its
successor.

`initial cycle point = "now"`.

[#2070](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2070): Fix dummy mode support for

suite name filtering via a `--name` command line option.

[#2060](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2060): 5-second timeout if hanging
connections are encountered during port scanning.

[#2055](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2055): Task elapsed times now persist
over restarts.

[#2046](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2046): Multi-task interface for `cylc
show`. Fixed *View Prerequisites* for tasks in the runahead pool.

[#2049](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2049): Per-host job submission and
execution polling intervals via global/user config files.

[#2051](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2051): Bundle Jinja2 2.8 with Cylc -

kill to fail in some cases, for tasks in this category).


## __cylc-6.11.3 (2016-12-21)__

One minor bug fix on top of 6.11.2.

[#2091](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2091): Since 6.11.0 use of cylc-5
special "cold start tasks" caused downstream tasks to become immortal. This
fixes the problem, but note that you should no longer be using this deprecated
feature (which will be removed from cylc-7).


## __cylc-6.11.2 (2016-10-19)__

Some minor enhancements and fixes.

### Highlighted Changes

[#2034](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2034): Allow restart from checkpoints.

since 6.11.0 suite state dump files no longer exist).

[#2047](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2047): Documented the new
"[scheduling]spawn to max active cycle points" suite configuration item,
which allows successive instances of the same task to run out of order if the
opportunity arises.

mail footer (suite or site/user configuration).

[#2032](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2032): `cylc gui` -

Since 6.9.0 this would not force-spawn the successor of a waiting task.

[#2031](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2031): `cylc gscan` -
fixed occasional jumping status icons introduced in 6.11.1.

[#2040](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2040): Corrected documentation for
the `cylc cat-log` command (it was using the alias `cylc
log`).

Three minor bug fixes on top of 6.11.0:

[#2002](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2002): fix a bug in the graph string 
parser - if a task appears both with and without a cycle point offset in the 
same conditional trigger expression (unlikely, but possible!)

[#2007](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2007): fix handling of OS Error if
the user run into the limit for number of forked processes.

[#2008](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/2008): fix occasional traceback from

### Highlighted Changes

[#1953](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1953): Parameterized tasks: generate
tasks automatically without using messy Jinja2 loops.

[#1929](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1929): Under `[runtime]`:
 * New task `[[[job]]]` sub-sections unify the various batch system, job
   execution, and job polling settings (older settings deprecated).
 * A new `[[[job]]] execution time limit` setting allows cylc to:
    * automatically generate batch system time limit directives;
    * run background or at jobs with the `timeout` command;
    * poll job with configurable delays (default 1, 3, 10 minutes) after
      reaching the time limit.
 * Moved the content of the old `[event hooks]` section to a unified `[events]`
   section (older settings deprecated).

[#1884](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1884): `cylc gscan` displays a new
warning icon with a tool-tip summary of recent task failures.

[#1877](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1877): The `gcylc` status bar now
shows a countdown to the next suite connection attempt, and resets the
connection timer schedule if the user changes view settings.

[#1966](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1966): Optionally spawn waiting tasks
out to "max active cycle points" instead of one cycle point ahead. This means
successive instances of the same task can run out of order (dependencies
allowing).  Use with caution on large suites with a lot of runahead.

[#1940](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1940): Bash tab completion for cylc
commands.

### Other Changes

final cycle point in graph cycling section headings.  E.g. `[[[R1/^+PT1H]]]`
means "run once, one hour after the initial cycle point"; `[[[R1/$-PT1H]]]`
means "run once, one hour before the final cycle point".

[#1928](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1928): New notation for excluding a
cycle point from a recurrence expression, e.g. `[[[T00!^]]]` means 
"daily at T00 after but not including the initial cycle point".

[#1958](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1958): Suite daemon logging upgrade:
improved log file formatting; the log, out, and err files are now rolled over
together as soon as any one reaches the size limit.

[#1827](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1827): Suite state dump files no
longer exist - the suite run DB now records all restart information.

[#1912](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1912): Fixed coloured `cylc scan -c`
output (broken at 6.10.1).

[#1921](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1921): Don't ignore dependencies
among tasks back-inserted prior to a warm-start cycle point.

[#1910](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1910): Task job scripts now use `set
-o pipefail` to ensure that failure of any part of a shell pipeline causes a
job failure.

[#1886](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1886): When a job is submitted for
the first time, any job logs with higher submit numbers will be removed (
these must have been generated by a previous suite run).

[#1946](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1946): Removed annoying warnings
that "self-suicide is not recommended".

[#1889](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1889): Record any unhandled task
messages (e.g. general progress messages) in the suite DB.

[#1899](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1899): Custom task output messages
(for message triggers) are now automatically faked in dummy mode.

by a suite reload.

[#1844](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1844): Allow client commands from
another suite's task (these would previously load the passphrase for the parent
suite rather than the target suite).

[#1866](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1866): Allow explicitly unset
intervals in cylc config files, e.g. `execution timeout = # (nothing)`.

[#1863](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1863): Fixed a recent bug (since in
6.10.0) causing shutdown on reload of a suite after removing a task and its
runtime definition.

[#1864](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/): Stronger checks to prevent users 
starting a second instance of a suite that is already running.

[#1869](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1869): Fixed day-of-week cycling.

[#1858](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1858): Fixed a recent bug (since

released to the `waiting` immediately, even if the suite is currently quiet.

[#1854](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/): Restore wildcards to allow 
insertion of multiple tasks at once (inadvertently disallowed at 6.10.0). 

[#1853](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1853): Fixed a recent bug (since
6.10.1): reset task outputs to incomplete on manually retriggering or resetting
to a pre-run state.

### Other Changes

[#1835](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1835): Suite reload - reload all
tasks at once (previously, current active tasks were reloaded only when they
finished, which could result in reloads appearing to take a long time).

[#1833](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1833): `gcylc` - initial task state
filtering configurable via the  `gcylc.rc` config file.

to change by suite reload after being orphaned by one reload (i.e. removed from
the suite) then re-inserted after another.

[#1804](https://github.com/cylc/cylc/pull/1804): PBS job name length - truncate
to 15 characters by default, but can now be configured in `global.rc` for PBS
