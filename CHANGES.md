## Backward-incompatible changes in Cylc-8.x

Cylc 8.0aX (alpha) releases are not compatible with Cylc 7 or with previous
8.0aX releases, as the API is still under heavy development.

The Cylc server program and CLI codebase is now a Python 3 package that can be
installed from PyPI with `pip` (see
[#2990](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2990)), and has been renamed to
`cylc-flow`. The name `cylc` is now used as a native Python package namespace
to allow other projects to re-use it and extend Cylc with plug-ins.

The old PyGTK GUI is being replaced by a Web UI, with development managed in
the cylc/cylc-ui repository (and see also cylc/cylc-uiserver).

The User Guide and other documentation has been removed from the Python package
to the cylc/cylc-doc repository.

The commands `cylc-profile-battery`, `cylc-test-battery`, `cylc-license`
have been removed, and `cylc graph` is only retained for text output
used in tests (it will be re-implemented in the new web UI).

The xtrigger examples were moved to a separate `cylc/cylc-xtriggers` project
(see [#3123](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3123)).

Jinja filters were moved from its `Jinja2Filters` folder to within the `cylc`
namespace, under `cylc.jinja.filters`.

Cylc Review was also removed in this version.

Cylc 7 suites cannot be *restarted* (from previous state) with Cylc 8, but they
can still be started from scratch
([#3863](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3863)).

Named checkpoints have been removed ([#3906](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3906))
due to being a seldom-used feature. Workflows can still be restarted from the
last run, or reflow can be used to achieve the same result.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## __cylc-8.0b0 (<span actions:bind='release-date'>Released 2021-03-29</span>)__

First beta release of Cylc 8.

(See note on cylc-8 backward-incompatible changes, above)

The filenames `suite.rc` and `global.rc` are now deprecated in favour of
`flow.cylc` and `global.cylc` respectively
([#3755](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3755)). For backward
compatibility, the `cylc run` command will automatically symlink an existing
`suite.rc` file to `flow.cylc`.

Obsolete *queued* task state replaced by *waiting*, with a queued flag;
queueing logic centralized.
([#4088](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4088)).

`cylc register` has been replaced by `cylc install`
([#4000](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4000)).

Added a new command: `cylc clean`, for removing stopped workflows on the local
and any remote filesystems ([#3961](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3961),
[#4017](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4017)).

`cylc run` and `cylc restart` have been replaced by `cylc play`, simplifying
how workflows are restarted
([#4040](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4040)).

`cylc pause` and `cylc play` are now used to pause and resume workflows,
respectively. `cylc hold` and `cylc release` now only hold and release tasks,
not the whole workflow. ([#4076](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4076))

"Implicit"/"naked" tasks (tasks that do not have an explicit definition in
`flow.cylc[runtime]`) are now disallowed by default
([#4109](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4109)). You can allow them by
setting `flow.cylc[scheduler]allow implicit tasks` to `True`.

### Enhancements

[#4119](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4119) - Reimplement ssh task
communications.

[#4115](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4115) - Raise an error when
invalid sort keys are provided clients.

[#4105](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4105) - Replace the
`cylc executable` global config setting with `cylc path`, for consistency with
`cylc` invocation in job scripts.

[#4014](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4014) - Rename "ready" task
state to "preparing".

[#4000](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4000) - `cylc install` command
added. Install workflows into cylc run directory from source directories
configured in `global.cylc` (see [#4132](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4132)),
or from arbitrary locations.

[#4071](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4071) - `cylc reinstall` command
added.

[#3992](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3992) - Rename
batch system to job runner.

[#3791](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3791) - Support Slurm
heterogeneous jobs with a special directive prefix.

[#3974](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3974) - Template variables,
both in set files and provided via the -s/--set command line options are
now parsed using ast.literal_eval. This permits non-string data types,
strings must now be quoted.

[#3811](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3811) - Move from cycle based
to `n` distance dependency graph window node generation and pruning of the
data-store (API/visual backing data). Ability to modify distance of live
workflow via API, with default of `n=1`.

[#3899](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3899) - CLI changes
* Commands no longer re-invoke (so you get `cylc run` not `cylc-run`).
* Improve CLI descriptions and help.
* Internal-only commands now hidden from help.
* New entry point for defining Cylc sub-commands.
* remove `cylc check-software` (use standard tools like pipdeptree)
* remove `cylc nudge` (no longer needed)

[#3884](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3884) - Directories `run`,
`log`, `share`, `share/cycle`, `work` now have the option to be redirected to
configured directories by symlink.

[#3856](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3856) - fail the GraphQL query
with a helpful message if the variables defined do not match the expected
values.

[#3853](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3853) - Update protobuf and
pyzmq.

[#3857](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3857) - removed the obsolete
"runahead" task state (not used since spawn-on-demand implementation).

[#3816](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3816) - change `cylc spawn`
command name to `cylc set-outputs` to better reflect its role in Cylc 8.

[#3796](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3796) - Remote installation is
now on a per install target rather than a per platform basis. `app/`, `bin/`,
`etc/`, `lib/` directories are now installed on the target, configurable in flow.cylc.

[#3724](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3724) - Re-implemented
the `cylc scan` command line interface and added a Python API for accessing
workflow scanning functionality.

[#3515](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3515) - spawn-on-demand: a more
efficient way of the evolving the workflow via the graph.

[#3692](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3692) - Use the `$EDITOR`
and `$GEDITOR` environment variables to determine the default editor to use.

[#3574](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3574) - use the bash
installation defined in $path rather than hardcoding to /bin/bash.

[#3774](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3774) - Removed support for
interactive prompt.

[#3798](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3798) - Deprecated the
`[runtime][X][parameter environment templates]` section and instead allow
templates in `[runtime][X][environment]`.

[#3802](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3802) - New global config
hierarchy and ability to set site config directory.

[#3848](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3848) - Deprecated
`[scheduling]max active cycle points` in favour of `[scheduling]runahead limit`.

[#3883](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3883) - Added a new workflow
config option `[scheduling]stop after cycle point`.

[#3913](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3913) - Added the ability to
use plugins to parse suite templating variables and additional files to
install. Only one such plugin exists at the time of writing, designed to
parse ``rose-suite.conf`` files in repository "cylc-rose".

[#3955](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3955) - Global config options
to control the job submission environment.

[#4020](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4020) - `cylc validate` will no
longer check for a cyclic/circular graph if there are more than 100 tasks,
unless the option  `--check-circular` is used. This is to improve performance.

[#3913](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3913) - Add ability to use
pre-install entry point from cylc-rose plugin to provide environment and
template variables for a workflow.

[#4023](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4023) - Add ability to use
post-install entry point from cylc-rose to use Rose style CLI settings of
configurations in Cylc install. If Cylc-rose is installed three new CLI
options will be available:
- `--opt_conf_keys="foo, bar"`
- `--defines="[env]FOO=BAR"`
- `--suite-defines="FOO=BAR"`

[#4101](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4101) - Add the ability to
ignore (clear) rose install options from an earlier install:
`cylc reinstall --clear-rose-install-options`

[#4094](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4094) - Prevent Cylc from
rsyncing the following files on install and reinstall:
- `rose-suite.conf`
- `opt/rose-suite-cylc-install.conf`
These files should be handled by the cylc-rose plugin if you require them.

[#4126](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4126) - Make obselete the config
``flow.cylc:[runtime][__TASK__][remote]suite definition directory``.

[#4098](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4098) - Provide a dictionary called
CYLC_TEMPLATE_VARS into the templating environment.

[#4099](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4099) - Unify `cylc get-suite-config`
and `cylc get-site-config` commands as `cylc config`. Some options have been
removed.

### Fixes

[#3984](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3984) - Only write task
event timers to the database when they have changed (reverts behaviour
change in 7.8.6). This corrects last updated db entries and reduces filesystem
load.

[#3917](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3917) - Fix a bug that caused
one of the hostname resolution tests to fail in certain environments.

[#3879](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3879) - Removed Google
Groups e-mail from pip packaging metadata. Users browsing PYPI will have
to visit our website to find out how to reach us (we are using Discourse
and it does not offer an e-mail address).

[#3859](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3859) - Fixes the query of
broadcast states to retrieve only the data for the requested ID, instead
of returning all the broadcast states in the database.

[#3815](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3815) - Fixes a minor bug in the
auto-restart functionality which caused suites to wait for local jobs running
on *any* host to complete before restarting.

[#3732](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3732) - XTrigger labels
are now validated to ensure that runtime errors can not occur when
exporting environment variables.

[#3632](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3632) - Fix a bug that was causing
`UTC mode` specified in global config to be pretty much ignored.

[#3614](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3614) - Ensure the suite always
restarts using the same time zone as the last `cylc run`.

[#3788](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3788),
[#3820](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3820) - Task messages and
task outputs/message triggers are now validated.

[#3614](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3795) - Fix error when running
`cylc ping --verbose $SUITE`.

[#3852](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3852) - Prevents registering a
workflow in a sub-directory of a run directory (as `cylc scan` would not be
able to find it).

[#3452](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3452) - Fix param graph
issue when mixing offset and conditional (e.g. foo<m-1> & baz => foo<m>).

[#3982](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3982) - Fix bug preventing
workflow from shutting down properly on a keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C) in
Python 3.8+.

[#4011](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4011) - Fix bug where including
a trailing slash in the suite/workflow name would cause `cylc stop`
(and possibly other commands) to silently fail.

[#4046](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/4046) - Fix bug where a workflow
database could still be active for a short time after the workflow stops.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## __cylc-8.0a2 (2020-07-03)__

includes CLI utility: `cylc subscribe`.

[#3402](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3402) - removed automatic task
job status message retries (problems that prevent message transmission are
almost never transient, and in practice job polling is the only way to
recover).

[#3463](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3463) - cylc tui:
A new terminal user interface to replace the old `cylc monitor`.

there is now a default initial cycle point of 1.

[#3423](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3423) - automatic task retries
re-implemented using xtriggers. Retrying tasks will now be in the "waiting"
state with a wall_clock xtrigger set for the retry time.

### Fixes

[#3618](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3618) - Clear queue configuration
warnings for referencing undefined or unused tasks.

[#3596](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3596) - Fix a bug that could
prevent housekeeping of the task_action_timers DB table and cause many warnings
at restart.

[#3602](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3602) - Fix a bug that prevented
cycle point format conversion by the `cylc suite-state` command and the
`suite_state` xtrigger function, if the target suite used the default format
but downstream command or suite did not.

[#3541](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3541) - Don't warn that a task
was already added to an internal queue, if the queue is the same.

[#3409](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3409) - prevent cylc-run from
creating directories when executed for suites that do not exist.

[#3433](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3433) - fix server abort at
shutdown during remote run dir tidy (introduced during Cylc 8 development).

[#3493](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3493) - Update jinja2 and
pyzmq, as well as some test/dev dependencies. Fixes Jinja2 error where
validation shows incorrect context.

[#3272](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3272),
[#3191](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3191) - uniform configuration
section level for defining non-cycling and cycling graphs. E.g.:

```
# Deprecated Syntax
[scheduling]
    initial cycle point = next(T00)
    [[dependencies]]
        [[[P1D]]]
            graph = task1 => task2
```

Can now be written as:

```
# New Syntax
[scheduling]
    initial cycle point = next(T00)
    [[graph]]
        P1D = task1 => task2
```

[#3249](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3249) - export the environment
variable `ISODATETIMEREF` (reference time for the `isodatetime` command from
[metomi-isodatetime](https://github.com/metomi/isodatetime/)) in task jobs to
have the same value as `CYLC_TASK_CYCLE_POINT`.

[#3286](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3286) -
Removed the `cylc check-triggering` command.
Changed the `suite.rc` schema:
* Removed `[cylc]log resolved dependencies`
* Removed `[cylc][[reference test]]*` except `expected task failures`.
* Moved `[cylc]abort if any task fails` to
  `[cylc][[events]]abort if any task fails` so it lives with the other
  `abort if/on ...` settings.

[#3351](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3351) - sped up suite validation
(which also affects responsiveness of suite controllers during suite startup,
restarts, and reloads).  Impact of the speedup is most noticeable when dealing
with suite configurations that contain tasks with many task outputs.

[#3358](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3358) - on submitting jobs to
SLURM or LSF, the job names will now follow the pattern `task.cycle.suite`
(instead of `suite.task.cycle`), for consistency with jobs on PBS.

[#3356](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3356) - default job name length
maximum for PBS is now 236 characters (i.e. assuming PBS 13 or newer). If you
are still using PBS 12 or older, you should add a site configuration to
restrict it to 15 characters.

### Fixes

to xrandom.

[#3018](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3018) - subprocpool: use

array access in cylc check-software.

[#3035](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3035) - fix scheduler#shutdown
when reference-log option is used.

assumption in a test.

[#3112](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3112) - prepend custom

port configuration for zmq.

[#3153](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3153) - fix bug in
async_map.

[#3164](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3164) - fix pclient
undefined error.

[#3173](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/issues/3173) - NameError when
invalid cylc command is used (instead of a ValueError).

[#3003](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3003) - Fix inheritance
with quotes using shlex.

[#3184](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3184) - Fix restart
correctness when the suite has a hold point, stop point, a stop task, a stop
clock time and/or an auto stop option. These settings are now stored in the
suite run SQLite file and are retrieved on suite restart. In addition, the
settings are removed when they are consumed, e.g. if the suite stopped
previously on reaching the stop point, the stop point would be consumed, so
that on restart the suite would not stop again immediately.

The `cylc run` command can now accept `--initial-cycle-point=CYCLE-POINT`
(`--icp=CYCLE-POINT)` and `--start-cycle-point=CYCLE-POINT` options. This
change should allow the command to have  a more uniform interface with commands
such as `cylc validate`, and with the final/stop cycle point options).

After this change:
* `cylc run SUITE POINT` is equivalent to `cylc run --icp=POINT SUITE`.
* `cylc run -w SUITE POINT` is equivalent to
  `cylc run -w --start-point=POINT SUITE`.

The `cylc run` and `cylc restart` commands can now accept the
`--final-cycle-point=POINT` and `--stop-cycle-point=POINT` options. The
`--until=POINT` option is now an alias for `--final-cycle-point=POINT` option.

The `cylc run` and `cylc restart` commands can now accept the new
`--auto-shutdown` option. This option overrides the equivalent suite
configuration to force auto shutdown to be enabled. Previously, it is only
possible to disable auto shutdown on the command line.

[#3236](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3236) - Fix submit number
increment logic on insert of family with tasks that were previously submitted.

[#3276](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3276) - Fix log & DB recording
of broadcasts from xtriggers so they register all settings, not just one.

[#3325](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/3325) - Fix task event handler
*start_time* being unavailable in *started* events.

## __cylc-7.8.0 (2018-11-27)__

Minor release with over 120 issues closed. Significant issues include:

### Enhancements

[#2693](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2693) - __auto host selection__; and
[#2809](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2809) - __auto migration__.
`cylc run` and `cylc restart` can now select the best host (based on several
metrics) on which to launch suite server programs. And running suites
can be told (via global config) to self-migrate to another available host, e.g.
for server maintenance. (The pool of suite hosts should see a shared
filesystem).

[#2614](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2614) and
[#2821](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2821) - __web-based job log viewer__ -
 `cylc review` (migration of "Rose Bush" from the Rose project).


[#2339](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2339) - __general external
triggering__: tasks can trigger off of arbitrary user-defined Python functions
called periodically by the suite server program, with built-in functions
for suite-state (inter-suite) triggering and clock triggering (these
deprecate the existing suite-state polling tasks and clock-triggered tasks).

[#2734](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2734) - __EmPy templating__
support, as an alternative to Jinja2. _"EmPy allows embedding plain Python code
within templates and doesn't enforce any particular templating philosophy."_

[#2733](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2733) - enhanced Jinja2 support:
- __import pure Python modules__ in the same way as template modules
- Jinja2Tests and Jinja2Globals, for custom "is" tests and global variables
  (c.f. our existing Jinja2Filters for custom filters).

[#2682](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2682) - new built-in
Jinja2 filter to convert ISO8601 date-time durations to
decimal seconds or hours.

[#2842](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2842) - `cylc gui` and
`cylc graph` - better integration with system desktop themes, including dark
themes; and other minor graph visualization improvements.

[#2807](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2807) - task output events (event
handlers can now be triggered when a task reports a registered output message).

[#2868](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2868) - a new task
runtime config item `exit-script`, for scripting to be executed at the
last moment after successful job completion. (Companion of `err-script`).

[#2781](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2781) and
[#2854](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2854) - improved suite
server program logging (including: `log/suite/err` is no longer used).

[#2849](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2849) - record local
background jobs by host name rather than "localhost".

[#2877](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2877) - new batch system
handler `pbs_multi_cluster`, supports PBS 13 clients fronting
heterogeneous clusters with different home directories from the
cylc remote. (Not needed for PBS 14+.) (For Rose suites this requires a
corresponding change to `rose suite-run`:
[metomi/rose#2252](https://github.com/metomi/rose/pull/2252).)

[#2812](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2812) - `cylc gscan`:
show application menu bar by default.

[#2768](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2768) - `cylc gscan`: display Cylc
version of running suites.

[#2786](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2786) - make task try number
available to event handlers (as for task job submit number).

[#2771](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2771) - bash command completion:
complete suite names for commands that take a suite name argument (see
`etc/cylc-bash-completion`).

[#2769](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2769) - `cylc check-software` now
takes arguments to check for availability of specific modules.

[#2763](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2763) - `cylc monitor` - clean exit
on Ctrl-C.

[#2704](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2704) - paginated `cylc help` output.

[#2660](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2660) - new `gcylc.rc` config item to
show grouped cyclepoint subgraphs by default.

[#2766](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2766) - (development) formal test
coverage reporting and integration with GitHub.

[#2751](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2751) - (development) new contributor
guidelines - see `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

### Fixes

[#2876](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2876) - avoid subprocess hang when
executing commands that generate a lot of stdout (such as when submitting
hundreds of jobs at once).

[#2828](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2828) - `suite.rc` - fail validation
on detecting trailing whitespace after a line continuation character.

[#2807](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2807) - handle multiple events of
the same type with the same message (e.g. warnings) from the same task job.

[#2803](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2803) - reset job submit number
correctly after aborting (backing out of) a trigger edit-run.

[#2727](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2727) - `cylc gui`: fix dropdown list
of log numbers for re-inserted tasks or after suite
restart.

[#2759](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2759) and
[#2816](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2816) -
suite registration tweaks and fixes.

[#2861](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2861) - improved emacs
syntax highlighting.

[#2892](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2892) - print the bad host name along
with "Name or service not known" exceptions.

with ithe use of final cycle point in multiple recurrence expressions

[#2723](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2723) - fix remote commands (executed
by remote task jobs) running in UTC mode when the suite is not running in UTC
mode

[#2726](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2726) - fix crash in suites with no
final cycle point that are reloaded following a restart

[#2716](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2716) - ensure that job polling
interval lists are not overridden

[#2714](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2714) - block irrelevant
`InsecureRequestWarning`s from urllib3 on anonymous suite server access by
`cylc scan` and `cylc ping`

[#2715](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2715) - fix a cross-version
incompatibility, if a cylc-7.6.x task job messages a cylc-7.7.1 suite

[#2710](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2710) - fix a GUI error on
right-clicking a "scissor node" in the graph view

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## __cylc-7.7.1 (2018-06-27)__

Minor maintenance release.

### Fixes

(Several minor fixes have been omitted from this list.)

[#2678](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2678) - fix loading of job poll
timers on restart (bug introduced at last release)

[#2683](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2683) - fix potential error in
`cylc check-software` (which checks for installed software dependencies)

[#2691](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2691) PBS support - handle job poll
result correctly if qstat temporarily fails to connect to the server

[#2703](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2703) - fix an error
(inconsequential) that appears in the suite log at restart: `ValueError: No
JSON object could be decoded`

[#2692](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2692) - fix X11 forwarding for GUI
edit job log, with `cylc gui --host=HOST`

[#2690](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2690) - invoking Cylc command help
should not require `$DISPLAY` to be set

[#2677](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2677) - use random serial numbers in
the self-signed SSL certificates generated by suite server programs

[#2688](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2688)
[#2705](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2705) - block several security
warnings emitted by `urllib3` under old Python versions (2.6). *We are
aware of the security issues, but these warnings serve no purpose on affected
platforms except to confuse and annoy users.*

[#2676](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2676) - use `#!/usr/bin/env python2`
(i.e. Python-2 specific) in Cylc source files, to avoid issues with default
Python 3 installations (note Cylc is going to Python 3 next year)

[#2679](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2679) - change bold font back to
normal in the GUI log viewer

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## __cylc-7.7.0 (2018-05-12)__

### Enhancements

[#2661](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2661) -
 * new User Guide section on Remote Job Management
 * tidy the installation documentation
 * standardise directory structures (all docs updated accordingly):
   - deprecated `<cylc-dir>conf/` file locations:
     - site config file `<cylc-dir>etc/global.rc`
     - gcylc config example `<cylc-dir>/etc/gcylc.rc.eg`
     - site job environment init `<cylc-dir/etc/job-init-env.sh`
     - editor syntax files in `<cylc-dir>etc/syntax/`
     - bash completion script `<cylc-dir>/etc/cylc-bash-completion`
   - user `global.rc` can now go in `~/.cylc/<cylc-version>/` or `~/.cylc/`
     (the version-specific location avoid forward compatibility problems - see
     notes in `<cylc-dir>/etc/global.rc.eg`).
   - moved central cylc wrapper template to `usr/bin/cylc`
   - various developer scripts and notes moved from `<cylc-dir>/dev/` to
     `<cylc-dir>/etc/dev-bin, dev-notes, dev-suites`.
   - *the ancient `site.rc` and `user.rc` global config filename variants are
     now obsolete.*

[#2659](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2659) - commands in the process pool
(event handlers, and job submit, poll and kill commands) will now be killed on
a configurable timeout if they hang, rather than tying up a member of the
finite process pool: `global.rc` default: `process pool timeout = PT10M`

[#2582](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2582) - improve client/server
interface, including: `cylc message` can send multiple messages at once, with
different severities; server ignores messages from superseded job submits;
running jobs detect that the suite has been cold-started under them and will
not attempt to connect; ssh-based indirect client-server communication now
works automatically for all clients, not just messaging.

[#2582](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2582),
[#2624](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2624), and earlier changes: all job
host actions are now done by remote `cylc` subcommands that are compatible with
ssh whitelisting.

[#2590](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2590) - replaced the fixed process
pool with direct management of individual sub-processes (for external commands
executed by the server program).

[#2561](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2561) - pass resolved triggering
dependencies to `$CYLC_TASK_DEPENDENCIES` in job environments.

[#2639](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2639) - date-time cycling: document
availability of 365-day (never a leap year) and 366-day (always a leap year)
calendars.

[#2597](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2597) - emit a "late" event if a task
has not triggered by a user-defined real-time offset relative to cycle point.

[#2648](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2648) - improve version reporting.
Note than non-standard lowercase `cylc -v` is now gone; use `cylc -V` or `cylc
--version`, with optional `--long` format to print as well as version.

[#2620](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2620) - re-document the long-dated
`[special tasks]sequential` and recommend using explicit dependencies in the
graph instead.

[#2584](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2584) - internal queues now release
task jobs on a FIFO (First In, First Out) basis, rather than randomly.

[#2538](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2538) - remove leading whitespace
from multi-line `script` items in task definitions, for cleaner job scripts.

[#2503](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2503),
[#2624](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2624) - `cylc cat-log`: all remote
host actions now done by a `cylc` sub-command; and simpler command options (see
`cylc cat-log --help`; **warning: the old command options are not supported**)

### Fixes

[#2666](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2666) - `cylc scan`: make default
behavior consistent with `cylc gscan`: get suite information from `~/cylc-run/`
only for the current user; and no partial matches with `-n/--name=PATTERN`
(i.e. `--name=bar` will only match the suite `bar`, not `foobar` or `barbaz`).

[#2593](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2593) - fix polling after job
execution timeout (configured pre-poll delays were being ignored).

[#2656](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2656) - fix suicide triggers with
multiple prerequisites in the same graph line.

[#2638](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2638) - fix duplicate "failed" task
events after `cylc stop --kill`.

[#2653](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2653) - tidy and correct the main `cylc
help` documentation.

[#2644](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2644),
[#2646](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2646) - fix some graph parsing edge
cases.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## __cylc-7.6.1 (2018-03-28)__

A collection of bug fixes made since cylc-7.6.0.

### Fixes

[#2571](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2571) - `cylc gui`: fix tailing of
remote job logs from the GUI (in 7.6.0 this failed with a Python traceback).

[#2596](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2596) - allow parameter values that
contain +/- characters

[#2574](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2574) - `cylc gscan HOST`: show just
the owner's suites by default (at 7.6.0 this showed all suites on HOST).

[#2592](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2592) - `cylc trigger --edit`:
disable job script syntax checking in edit runs (this prevented a new job
script from being written for editing).

[#2579](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2579) - `cylc gscan`: fix respawning
error dialog on giving a bad regular expression (on the command line) to match
owner or suite name.

[#2606](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2606) - jobs with batch system info
missing in a corrupted status file (thus not pollable) will now poll as failed
rather appear stuck as running.

[#2603](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2603) - `cylc gui` (graph view): fix
possible error on inserting a nested family.

[#2602](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2602) - `cylc gui` (tree view): fix
negative progress bar value (reportedly possible after manual task state
manipulations).

[#2586](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2586) - `cylc gui` (tree view): fix
possible division-by-zero error in elapsed time computation.

[#2588](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2588) - `cylc trigger --edit`: fix
edit runs for tasks with dynamic remote host selection.

[#2585](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2585) - fix recovery from a failed
host select command.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## __cylc-7.6.0 (2018-02-07)__

### Enhancements

[#2373](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2373) - refactored suite server code
(for efficiency, maintainability, etc.)

[#2396](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2396) - improved job polling and task
state reset:
 * allow polling of finished tasks - to confirm they really succeeded or failed
 * poll to confirm a task message that implies a state reversal - it could just
   be a delayed message
 * allow reset to submitted or running states
 * removed the "enable resurrection" setting - any task can now return from the
   dead

[#2410](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2410) - new CUSTOM severity task
messages that can trigger a custom event handler

[#2420](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2420) - `cylc monitor` now
reconnects automatically if its target suite gets restarted on a different port

[#2430](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2430) - `cylc gscan`,
`cylc gui` - significant reduction in impact on suite server
programs

[#2433](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2433) - "group" (used to group suites
in `cylc gscan`) is now defined under the suite "[[meta]]" section

[#2424](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2424) - task job scripts now run in
`bash -l` (login shell) instead of explicitly sourcing your
`.profile` file. *WARNING*: if you have a
`.bash_profile` and were using `.profile` as well just for
Cylc, the latter file will now be ignored because bash gives precedence to the
former. If so, just move your Cylc settings into
`.bash_profile` or consult the Cylc User Guide for
other ways to configure the task job environment.

[#2441](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2441) -
[#2458](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2458) - allow more event handler
arguments:
 * batch system name and job ID
 * submit time, start time, finish time
 * user@host

[#2455](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2455) - network client improvements:
 * on a failed connection, clients detect if the suite has stopped according to
   the contact file, then report it stopped and remove the contact file
 * on attempt run an already-running suite (contact file exists) print more
   information on how old the suite is and how to shut it down
 * clients running in plain HTTP protocol will no longer attempt to fetch a
   non-existent SSL certificate
 * if a contact file is loaded, always use the values in it to avoid
   conflicting host strings in SSL certificate file, etc.

[#2468](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2468) - initialize task remotes
asynchronously via the multiprocessing pool, to avoid holding up suite start-up
unnecessarily. *WARNING* this introduces new remote commands: `cylc
remote-init` and `cylc remote-tidy` that will affect sites
using ssh whitelisting

User Guide:
 * rewrote the section on restart from state checkpoints
 * rewrote the section on suite run databases
 * new section on suite contact files
 * new section on disaster recovery
 * new section on remote monitoring and control
 * improved terminology:
   * "suite server program" instead of "suite daemon" (it's not always a daemon)
   * "severity" instead of "priority" for logging and task messaging
   * "task remote" to encompass the concept of "the account where a task job
     runs" whether under the same user account or not, on another host or not
 * documented requirements for remote access to suite-parsing and
   file-retrieval commands, including via the GUI; and clarified the same for
   suite client commands
 * documented a known bug in use of parameters in complex graph syntax (and an
   easy workaround) - see the task parameters section
 * documented kill-to-hold behavior of tasks with retries configured

[#2475](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2475) - suite server program:
separate debug mode from daemonization

[#2485](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2485) - export task job environment
variables on definition and before assignment, to ensure they are available to
subshells immediately - even in expressions inside subsequent variable
definitions

[#2489](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2489) -
[#2557](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2557) -
`cylc gscan` -
 * configurable menubar visibility at start-up
 * grouped suites now retain their grouped status once stopped

 * job log files:
   * fix and document the "extra log files" setting
   * add "view in editor" support for extra log files
   * add text-editor functionality to `cylc jobscript`
   * add "preview jobscript" functionality to the GUI

[#2556](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2556) -
improved parameter support:
 * allow "%d" integer format in parameter templates
 * allow out of range parameter on graph RHS
 * allow positive offset for parameter index on graph
 * allow negative integer parameters
 * allow custom templating of parameter environment variables, in addition to
   the built-in `CYLC_TASK_PARAM\_&lt;param-name&gt;`
 * allow bare parameter values as task names
 * allow explicit parameter values in "inherit" items under "[runtime]"
 * fix parameters inside (as opposed to beginning or end) of family names
 * fixed inheritance from multiple parameterized namespaces at once

[#2553](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2553) - upgraded the bundled Jinja2
version to 2.10. This fixes the block scope problem introduced in the previous
version

[#2558](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2558) - new options to print out JSON
format from `cylc show` and `cylc scan`

### Fixes

[#2381](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2381) - validation: fail bad event
handler argument templates

[#2416](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2416) - validation: print the problem
namespace in case of bad multiple inheritance

[#2426](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2426) - validation: fail
non-predefined config item names (e.g. batch scheduler directives) that contain
multiple consecutive spaces (to ensure that hard-to-spot whitespace typos don't
prevent repeated items from overriding as intended)

[#2432](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2432) - fixed an issue that could
cause HTTPS client failure due to SSL certificate host name mismatch

[#2434](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2434) - correctly strip "at TIME"
from the end of multi-line task messages

[#2440](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2440) - `cylc suite-state`
- fixed DB query of tasks with custom outputs that have not been generated yet

[#2444](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2444) - added `cylc
report-timings` to main command help

[#2449](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2449):
 * server suite and task URLs from suite server programs, rather than parsing
   them from the suite definition - so browsing URLs from a remote GUI now
   works
 * allow proper string templating of suite and task names in URLs; retained the
   old pseudo environment variables for backward compatibility

[#2461](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2461) - fixed manual task retrigger
after an aborted edit run - this was erroneously using the edited job file

[#2462](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2462) - fixed job polling for the SGE
batch scheduler

[#2464](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2464) - fixed the ssh+HTTPS task

better handle suite parsing errors on view refresh

[#2496](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2496) - ensure that broadcasted
environment variables are defined before all user-defined variables, which may
need to reference the broadcasted ones

[#2523](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2523) - fixed a problem with suicide
triggers: with several used at once, tasks could go untriggered

[#2546](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2546) - fixed problems with stop
point after a suite reload: do not reset an existing stop point (this is
dangerous, but it could be done before, and the stop point in the GUI status
bar would still refer to the original)

[#2562](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2562) - improved advice on how to
generate an initial user config file (`global.rc`)

[#2330](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2330): New suite.rc `[meta]` sections
for suite and task metadata. These hold the existing `title`, `description`,
and `URL` items, plus arbitrary user-defined items. Metadata items can be passed
to event handlers (e.g. a site-specific task "priority" or "importance" rating
could inform an event-handler's decision on whether or not to escalate task
failures).

[#2407](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2407): Documented exactly how Cylc
uses ssh, scp, and rsync to interact with remote job hosts.

[#2346](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2346),

[#2343](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2343): Improved the "Running
Suites" section of the User Guide, including documentation of suite remote
control.

[#2344](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2344): Attempt to access suite
service files via the filesystem first, before ssh, for other accounts on the
suite host.

parameter configuration.

[#2314](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2314): In debug mode, send bash job
script xtrace output (from `set -x`) to a separate log file.

### Fixes

[#2409](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2409): Fixed the `cylc spawn` command

command line templates gracefully.

[#2308](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2308): The parameterized task
environment variable `$CYLC_TASK_PARAM_<param>` is now guaranteed to be defined
before any use of it in the user-defined task environment section.

[#2296](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2296): Prevent suites stalling after
a restart that closely follows a warm-start (now the restart, like the warm
start, ignores dependence on tasks from before the warm start point).

[#2295](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2295): Fixed `cylc cat-log` "open in
editor" functionality for remote job logs.

[#2412](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2412): Fixed duplication of log

   dummy running other-site suites).
 * proportional run length, if tasks configure an `execution time limit`
 * single common `[simulation]` configuration section for dummy, dummy-local, and
   simulation modes.
 * dummy or simulated tasks can be made to fail at specific cycle points, and
   for first-try only, or all tries.
 * custom message outputs now work in simulation mode as well as the dummy modes.

Note that cylc-7 bug fixes were back-ported to a series of 6.11.x releases,
for those who have not transitioned to cylc-7 yet.

### Highlighted Changes

[#1923](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/1923): **A new HTTPS communications
layer, replaces Pyro-3 Object RPC for all client-server communications.**
Suite daemons are now web servers!

[#2063](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2063): **Removed deprecated cylc-5
syntax and features.**

[#2044](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2044): Suite start-up now aborts with
a sensible message on suite configuration errors (previously this happened post
daemonization so the user had to check suite logs to see the error).

files (passphrase, SSL files, contact file, etc.) under `.service/` in the
suite run directory; the suite registration database and port files under

[#2024](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2024): `cylc gscan` now supports
collapsible suite groups via a top level suite config `group` item.
Right-click *View Column* "Group".

[#2074](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2074): Task retry states and timers,
and poll timers, now persist across suite restarts. Waiting tasks are not
put in the held state before shutdown. Held tasks are not automatically
released on restart.

[#2004](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2004): Task event handlers are
now continued on restart.

### Other Changes

[#2042](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2042): Documented `[scheduling]spawn

get-suite-contact` to print suite contact information (host, port, PID, etc.)

[#2089](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2089): Improved documentation on
cycling workflows and use of parameterized tasks as a proxy for cycling.

[#2021](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2021): `cylc gui`: removed the
"connection failed" warning dialog that popped up on suite shutdown. This
should be obvious by the reconnection countdown timer in the info bar.

[#2023](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2023): New custom event email footer
via global or suite config.

[#2013](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2013): Fixed "remove task after
spawning" which since 6.9.0 would not force a waiting task to spawn its
successor.

[#2071](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2071): Fix quote stripping on
`initial cycle point = "now"`.

[#2070](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2070): Fix dummy mode support for
custom task outputs: they were incorrectly propagated to other tasks.

[#2065](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2065): `cylc gscan` now supports
suite name filtering via a `--name` command line option.

[#2060](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2060): 5-second timeout if hanging
connections are encountered during port scanning.

[#2055](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2055): Task elapsed times now persist
over restarts.

[#2046](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2046): Multi-task interface for `cylc
show`. Fixed *View Prerequisites* for tasks in the runahead pool.

[#2049](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2049): Per-host job submission and
execution polling intervals via global/user config files.

[#2051](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2051): Bundle Jinja2 2.8 with Cylc -

+suite definition reload, for task proxies that exist at the time of the reload.

[#2111](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2111): fixed member-expansion of
complex `(FAMILY:fail-any & FAMILYI:finish-all)` graph triggers.

[#2102](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2102): fixed validation of mixed
deprecated and new suite.rc syntax.

[#2098](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2098): fixed a problem with task host

kill to fail in some cases, for tasks in this category).


## __cylc-6.11.3 (2016-12-21)__

One minor bug fix on top of 6.11.2.

[#2091](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2091): Since 6.11.0 use of cylc-5
special "cold start tasks" caused downstream tasks to become immortal. This
fixes the problem, but note that you should no longer be using this deprecated
feature (which will be removed from cylc-7).


## __cylc-6.11.2 (2016-10-19)__

Some minor enhancements and fixes.

### Highlighted Changes

[#2034](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2034): Allow restart from checkpoints.
These are currently created before and after reloads, and on restart. (Note that
since 6.11.0 suite state dump files no longer exist).

[#2047](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2047): Documented the new
"[scheduling]spawn to max active cycle points" suite configuration item,
which allows successive instances of the same task to run out of order if the
opportunity arises.

[#2048](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2048): Allow "view prerequisites" for
tasks in the 'runahead' state.

[#2025](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2025): Provide a configurable event
mail footer (suite or site/user configuration).

[#2032](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2032): `cylc gui` -
removed the annoying warning dialog for connection failed. Take note of the
connection countdown in the status bar instead.

occasionally generated by the gcylc GUI log view window.

[#2018](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2018): Restored the incremental
printing of dots to stdout from the `cylc suite-state` polling
command (lost at 6.11.1).

[#2014](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2014): Fixed "remove after spawning".
Since 6.9.0 this would not force-spawn the successor of a waiting task.

[#2031](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2031): `cylc gscan` -
fixed occasional jumping status icons introduced in 6.11.1.

[#2040](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2040): Corrected documentation for
the `cylc cat-log` command (it was using the alias `cylc
log`).


## __cylc-6.11.1 (2016-09-22)__

Three minor bug fixes on top of 6.11.0:

[#2002](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2002): fix a bug in the graph string
parser - if a task appears both with and without a cycle point offset in the
same conditional trigger expression (unlikely, but possible!)

[#2007](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2007): fix handling of OS Error if
the user run into the limit for number of forked processes.

[#2008](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/2008): fix occasional traceback from
`cylc gsan`.



## __cylc-6.11.0 (2016-09-13)__

### Highlighted Changes

[#1953](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/1953): Parameterized tasks: generate
tasks automatically without using messy Jinja2 loops.

[#1929](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/1929): Under `[runtime]`:
 * New task `[[[job]]]` sub-sections unify the various batch system, job
   execution, and job polling settings (older settings deprecated).
 * A new `[[[job]]] execution time limit` setting allows cylc to:
    * automatically generate batch system time limit directives;
    * run background or at jobs with the `timeout` command;
    * poll job with configurable delays (default 1, 3, 10 minutes) after
      reaching the time limit.
 * Moved the content of the old `[event hooks]` section to a unified `[events]`
   section (older settings deprecated).

[#1884](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/1884): `cylc gscan` displays a new
warning icon with a tool-tip summary of recent task failures.

[#1877](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/1877): The `gcylc` status bar now
shows a countdown to the next suite connection attempt, and resets the
connection timer schedule if the user changes view settings.

[#1966](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/1966): Optionally spawn waiting tasks
out to "max active cycle points" instead of one cycle point ahead. This means
successive instances of the same task can run out of order (dependencies
allowing).  Use with caution on large suites with a lot of runahead.

[#1940](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/1940): Bash tab completion for cylc
commands.

### Other Changes

[#1585](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/1585): If a suite stalls, report any

final cycle point in graph cycling section headings.  E.g. `[[[R1/^+PT1H]]]`
means "run once, one hour after the initial cycle point"; `[[[R1/$-PT1H]]]`
means "run once, one hour before the final cycle point".

[#1928](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/1928): New notation for excluding a
cycle point from a recurrence expression, e.g. `[[[T00!^]]]` means
"daily at T00 after but not including the initial cycle point".

[#1958](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/1958): Suite daemon logging upgrade:
improved log file formatting; the log, out, and err files are now rolled over
together as soon as any one reaches the size limit.

[#1827](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/1827): Suite state dump files no
longer exist - the suite run DB now records all restart information.

[#1912](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/1912): Fixed coloured `cylc scan -c`
output (broken at 6.10.1).

[#1921](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/1921): Don't ignore dependencies
among tasks back-inserted prior to a warm-start cycle point.

[#1910](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/1910): Task job scripts now use `set
-o pipefail` to ensure that failure of any part of a shell pipeline causes a
job failure.

[#1886](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/1886): When a job is submitted for
the first time, any job logs with higher submit numbers will be removed (
these must have been generated by a previous suite run).

[#1946](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/1946): Removed annoying warnings
that "self-suicide is not recommended".

[#1889](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/1889): Record any unhandled task
messages (e.g. general progress messages) in the suite DB.

[#1899](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/1899): Custom task output messages
(for message triggers) are now automatically faked in dummy mode.

by a suite reload.

[#1844](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/1844): Allow client commands from
another suite's task (these would previously load the passphrase for the parent
suite rather than the target suite).

[#1866](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/1866): Allow explicitly unset
intervals in cylc config files, e.g. `execution timeout = # (nothing)`.

[#1863](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/1863): Fixed a recent bug (since in
6.10.0) causing shutdown on reload of a suite after removing a task and its
runtime definition.

[#1864](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/1864): Stronger checks to prevent
users starting a second instance of a suite that is already running.

released to the `waiting` immediately, even if the suite is currently quiet.

[#1854](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/1854): Restore wildcards to
allow insertion of multiple tasks at once (inadvertently disallowed at 6.10.0).

[#1853](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/1853): Fixed a recent bug (since
6.10.1): reset task outputs to incomplete on manually retriggering or resetting

event timer not resetting on task activity (since 6.10.0).

### Other Changes

[#1835](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/1835): Suite reload - reload all
tasks at once (previously, current active tasks were reloaded only when they
finished, which could result in reloads appearing to take a long time).

[#1833](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/1833): `gcylc` - initial task state
filtering configurable via the  `gcylc.rc` config file.

to change by suite reload after being orphaned by one reload (i.e. removed from
the suite) then re-inserted after another.

[#1804](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/pull/1804): PBS job name length - truncate
to 15 characters by default, but can now be configured in `global.rc` for PBS
