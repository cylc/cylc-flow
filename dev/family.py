# THIS IS THE OBSOLETE PSEUDO-TASK IMPLEMENTATION OF TASK FAMILIES.
# A pseudo-task object is put in the task pool to represent the family.
# The declared family members are made to automatically trigger off it,
# and the family object has extra prerequisites, that it attempts to 
# get satisfied at the same time as its normal prerequisites, used to
# determine its final state based on the states of its members.

class family( object ):
    """
Task family implementation in cylc: a task that just enters the running
state when ready, without running anything for real, so that it's members
can trigger off it.  Also it has two special prerequisite types: 
    1/ "family succeeded prerequisites" - these express dependence on all
    family members finishing successfully.
    2/ "family OR prerequisites" - conditional prerequisites that express
    dependence on (member1 succeeded OR failed) AND (member2 succeeded OR failed) AND ...
    If these are all satisfied it means that all members have either succeeded 
    or failed. They cannot be all satisfied while any task is
    yet to finish or fail.
Thus, we can tell by 1/ if ALL members succeeded => family succeeded;
and by 2/, if ALL members have either succeeded OR failed, i.e. no members 
are still waiting, submitted, or running. if 1/ is not all satisifed but two is => at
least one member failed => the family failed.  Downstream tasks can thus trigger off
a family finishing or failing, with no danger of triggering before some members may
still finish successfully, as could happen if the family entered the 'failed' state 
as soon as any one member failed.
