# DOCUMENTATION
- Can't have different optionality in different graph sections. If you need this,
    use different logical tasks to represent the same process.
- Optionality is not inferred from suicide triggers ('?" ignored)
- :start implies :succeed unless success or failure is otherwise defined
- Can't have ? on workflow polling task syntax

# note pre-initial ignore assumes specific outputs completed
- foo[-P1]:x => bar
This can screw up suicide based on previous-cycle outputs!
- foo[-P1]:y => !foo
Use a same-cycle prerequisite too
- foo[-P1]y & bar => !foo
(Or else explicitly start cycling beyond the initial point)
