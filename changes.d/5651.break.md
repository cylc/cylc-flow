Refinements to optional outputs:

* Require at least one optional output to be generated. This is a breaking
  change for some workflows e.g. `a? => b` where `a:fail?` is not referenced
  in the graph. To fix, set `[runtime][a]completion = succeeded or failed`.
* Allow the condition for task completion to be manually specified.
* Allow expiry events to be detected for tasks as soon as any of their
  prerequisites are satisfied (rather than when all of their prerequisites
  are satisfied).
