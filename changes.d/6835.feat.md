A new experimental feature that can be switched on in workflow config:
Suicide triggers expire tasks rather than just remove them. This fixes
a bug that could allow tasks to run after suicide triggering. The
"expired" output will automatically be marked as optional for the
task, but custom completion conditions must be adapted accordingly.
