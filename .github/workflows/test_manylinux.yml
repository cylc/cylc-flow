# Ensure that cylc-flow remains installable with manylinx1 binaries for use
# with older systems.

# Ideally we would use the Docker images from PyPa
# (https://github.com/pypa/manylinux).
# The manylinux1 image is based on CentOS=5, glibc=2.5), however, this is so
# old that installing contemporary Python on them is quite hard:
# * native package manager has no package for CentOS5
# * miniforge can't work with glibc < 2.12
# * micromamba can't work with glibc < 2.6
# * need zlib to compile Python / install pip but the package manager can't
#   download it because the package stream is offline (past EOL)

# So this will have to do. This isn't a perfect test as non manylinux compat
# packages may attempt to compile from source. This might succeed here but not
# on an older host.
