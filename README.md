Cylc (“silk”) orchestrates complex distributed suites of interdependent cycling
(or non-cycling) tasks. It was originally designed to automate environmental
forecasting systems at [NIWA](https://www.niwa.co.nz). Cylc is a general
workflow engine, however; it is not specialized to forecasting in any way.
