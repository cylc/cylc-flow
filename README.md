Cylc (pronounced silk) is a general purpose workflow engine that also
manages cycling systems very efficiently. It is used in production weather,
climate, and environmental forecasting on HPC, but is not specialized to those
domains.

### Quick Start


[Installation](https://cylc.github.io/cylc-doc/stable/html/installation.html) |
[Documentation](https://cylc.github.io/cylc-doc/stable/html/index.html)

```bash
# install cylc
conda install cylc-flow

# write your first workflow
mkdir -p ~/cylc-src/example
cat > ~/cylc-src/example/flow.cylc <<__CONFIG__
[scheduling]
    initial cycle point = 1
    cycling mode = integer
    [[graph]]
        P1 = """
            a => b => c & d
            b[-P1] => b
        """
[runtime]
    [[a, b, c, d]]
        script = echo "Hello $CYLC_TASK_NAME"
__CONFIG__

# install and run it
cylc install example
cylc play example

# watch it run
cylc tui example
```

### Migrating From Cylc 7

[Migration Guide](https://cylc.github.io/cylc-doc/stable/html/7-to-8/index.html)
| [Migration Support](https://cylc.discourse.group/c/cylc/7-to-8/13)

Cylc 8 can run most Cylc 7 workflows in compatibility mode with little to no
changes, go through the
[migration guide](https://cylc.github.io/cylc-doc/stable/html/7-to-8/index.html)
for more details.

Quick summary of major changes:

* Python 2 -> 3.
* Internal communications converted from HTTPS to ZMQ (TCP).
* PyGTK GUIs replaced by:
  * Terminal user interface (TUI) included in cylc-flow.
  * Web user interface provided by the cylc-uiserver package.
* A new scheduling algorithm with support for branched workflows.
* Command line changes:
  * `cylc run <id>` -> `cylc play <id>`
  * `cylc restart <id>` -> `cylc play <id>`
  * `rose suite-run` -> `cylc install; cylc play <id>`
* The core package containing Cylc scheduler program has been renamed cylc-flow.
* Cylc review has been removed, the Cylc 7 version remains Cylc 8 compatible.
