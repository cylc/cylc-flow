Parsec TODO list:

DOCUMENT STANDARD USAGE:
    a) define a file spec with validators
    b) derive a parsec config object to add any additional
    file-format-specific functionality (i.e. to transform the parsed
        data, or to parse the basic item values, or new methods to return
        derived information).
    c) do lazy load on import to parse the file(s)

EXPAND THE TEST BATTERY:
    - .e.g. test that things that shouldn't validate don't.

EXTENSION:
    - move section heading lists from cylc suite config into parsec?
    - move inheritance from cylc suite config into parsec?
    - test repeated section and item add-or-override)
    - test site/user style add-or-override
    - abort if compulsory items not found (currently prints a warning)
