    """For tasks with no previous instance dependence. These can in 
   principle spawn as soon as they are created, but that would result in
   waiting tasks spawning into the far future. Consequently we spawn on
   job submission; this prevents uncontrolled spawning but still allows
   successive instances to run in parallel if the opportunity arises. 
   
   Tasks that in principle have no previous instance dependence but
   which in practice cannot run in parallel with a previous instance
   (e.g. due to interference between temporary files) can be constrained
   with the sequential attribute if necessary (otherwise, imposing
   artificial dependence on the previous instance via prerequisites
   requires an associated cold-start task to get the suite started).

   A task can only fail after first being submitted, therefore a failed
   task should spawn if it hasn't already.
   
   Manually forcing a waiting task to the failed state will therefore
   result in it spawning (this is not the case for sequential tasks)."""
