# Cycling tasks: cycle time also required for a cold start. Init with: 
#  (1) cycle time
#  (2) state ('waiting', 'submitted', 'running', and 'succeeded' or 'failed')

# For a restart from previous state, however, some tasks may require
# additional state information to be stored in the state dump file.
# Take, for instance, a task foo that runs hourly and depends on the
# most recent available 12-hourly task bar, but is allowed to run ahead
# of bar to some extent, and changes its behavior according whether or
# not it was triggered by a "old" bar (i.e. one already used by the
# previous foo instance) or a "new" one. In this case, currently, we
# use a class variable in task type foo to record the cycle time of
# the most recent bar used by any foo instance. This is written to the
# the state dump file so that task foo does not have to automatically
# assume it was triggered by a "new" bar after a restart.

# To handle this difference in initial state information (between normal
# start and restart) task initialisation must use a default value of
# 'None' for the additional variables, and for a restart the task
# manager must instantiate each task with a flattened list of all the
# state values found in the state dump file.
