Passphrase location, order of preference:

1/ The dir argument (this is used for initial passphrase creation by the
register command, and if the user specifies the location on the command
line.

2/ The suite definition directory, because suites may be automatically
installed (e.g. by Rose) to remote task hosts, and remote tasks know
this location from their execution environment. Local user command
invocations can use the suite registration database to find the suite
definition directory.  HOWEVER, remote user command invocations cannot
do this even if the local and remote hosts share a common filesystem,
because we cannot be sure if finding the expected suite registration
implies a common filesystem or a different remote suite that happens to
be registered under the same name. User accounts used for remote control
must therefore install the passphrase in the secondary standard location
(below) or use the command line option to explicitly reveal the
location.

3/ $HOME/.cylc/HOST/OWNER/SUITE/; this is a more sensible location for
enabling remote suite control from accounts that do not actually need
the suite definition directory to be installed. OWNER is the username 
of the suite owner on the suite HOST.

4/ $HOME/.cylc/SUITE/; this is simpler than 3/ if you are not concerned
about other suites with the same name."""
