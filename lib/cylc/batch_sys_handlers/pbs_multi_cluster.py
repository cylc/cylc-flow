"""PBS batch system job submission and manipulation: multi-cluster variant.

Support PBS clients that front heterogeneous clusters where the Job ID returned
by qsub is <id>.<server>. PBS 13 qstat and qdel need <id>.<server>@<server>.
From PBS 14, the standard cylc PBS module works ("@<server>" is not needed).

So this PBS handler writes "job_id@server" to the job status file, and appends
"@server" to Job IDs returned by qstat, to matched the stored IDs.
