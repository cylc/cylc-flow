# PREREQUISITES:
# A collection of messages representing the prerequisite conditions
# of ONE TASK. "Satisfied" => the prerequisite has been satisfied.
# Prerequisites can interact with a broker (above) to get satisfied.

# FUZZY_PREREQUISITES:
# For cycle-time based prerequisites of the form "X more recent than
# or equal to this cycle time". A delimited time cutoff is expected
# in the message string. Requires a more complex satisfy_me() method.

# TO DO: THIS NEEDS TO BE UPDATED FOR NEW PREREQUISITE AND OUTPUT
# HANDLING.  SEE LOOSE_PREREQUISITES AS AN EXAMPLE.
