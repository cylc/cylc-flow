# A function that emulates the shell's 'mkdir -p', i.e. it creates
# intermediate directories if necessary AND does not throw an exception
# if the directory path already exists.

# Python's standard os.makedirs() fails if the directory already exists.
# We can check to see if it exists before calling os.makedirs(), but
# this causes a potential race condition: if another process creates the
# target directory between the check and the call.

# Judging from discussion on the Python dev list in 2010, this problem
# will be fixed in Python 3.?.  For now we have to roll our own ...
