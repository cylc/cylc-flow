Fetching the outgoing IP address of a computer might be a difficult
task. Computers can contain a large set of network devices, each
connected to different and independent sub-networks. Additionally there
might be available a number of devices, to be utilized in the manner of
network devices to exchange data with external systems.

However, if properly configured, your operating system knows what device
has to be utilized. Querying results depend on target addresses and
routing information. In our solution we are utilizing the features of
the local operating system to determine the correct network device. I
the same step we will get the associated network address.

To reach this goal we will utilize the UDP protocol. Unlike TCP/IP, UDP
is a stateless networking protocol to transfer single data packages. You
do not have to open a point-to-point connection to a service running at
the target host. We have to provide the target address to enable the
operating system to find the correct device. Due to the nature of UDP
you are not required to choose a valid target address. You just have to
make sure your are choosing an arbitrary address from the correct
subnet.

The following function is temporarily opening a UDP server socket. It is
returning the IP address associated with this socket.
    """

    # This finds the external address of the particular network adapter
    # responsible for connecting to the target?

    # Note that although no connection is made to the target, the target
    # must be reachable on the network (or just recorded in the DNS?) or
    # the function will hang and time out after a few seconds.
