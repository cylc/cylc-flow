def main( b ):
    help = helpwindow( "cylc db viewer Main Window Help", 500, """%h2 Overview

cylc db viewer displays your suite registration database. Using the menu
bar and right-click menu items you can register new suites; copy,
reregister, and unregister existing suites; start a suite control GUI to
run a dormant suite or to connect to one that is already running; or
edit, search, validate, and graph suite definitions.

%h2 Menu Bar

%h3 File > Register Existing Suite
Register an existing suite. This opens a file chooser dialog configured
to filter for cylc suite definition (suite.rc) files.

%h3 File > Create New Suite
Create a new suite, initially with an empty suite.rc file. This opens a
directory chooser dialog in which you can choose or create the new suite
definition directory.

%h3 File > Exit
Quits the db viewer application, but not any external programs you have
launched from the viewer (such as suite edit sessions or gcylc apps).

%h3 View > Filter
Change which suites are visible by searching on group and name match
patterns.

%h3 View > Expand
Expand the registration database treeview.

%h3 View > Collapse
Collapse the registration database treeview.

%h3 View > Refresh
Check the database for invalid registrations (e.g. due to manual
deletion of a suite definition directory) and update any suite
titles that have changed. Changes to the database (e.g. suites 
registered or unregistered) are automatically detected by the GUI, but
titles are normally only parsed from suite.rc files at registration
time - use refresh if you change a suite's title.

%h3 View > Reload
Reload the suite database from scratch.

%h3 Database > User
(Not currently used)

%h2 Right Click Menu Options

The Right-Click menu options available depend on whether you have
clicked on a running suite, a dormant suite, or a group of suites.  For
options relating to suite registration, registration groups are created
and deleted as required (you don't need to explicitly create group 'foo'
before registering a suite 'foo:bar', for example).

Most right-click menu items invoke cylc command line programs inside a
wrapper that captures subprocess stdout and stderr streams and displays
in a window that updates in real time. These output log windows can be
closed without affecting the associated subprocess.

%h3 Control -> Dot or Graph Control GUI

Launch a suite control GUI, with either the "dot" (LED) text treeview
interface, or the dependency graph interface, to start a suite running,
or to connect to a suite that is already running. 

%h3 Control -> Submit A Task

Submit a single task from the suite, exactly as it would be submitted by
the suite.

%h3 Preparation|Info -> Description

Print the suite description as parsed from the suite.rc file.

%h3 Preparation|Info -> Edit

Edit the suite.rc file, optionally inlined. See 'cylc edit --help'.

%h3 Preparation -> View

View a read-only copy of the suite.rc file, optionally inlined or 
pre-processed by Jinja2. See 'cylc view --help'.

%h3 Preparation|Info -> List

Print the suite's task list, or namespace hierarchy (tasks and families)
in tree form.

%h3 Preparation|Info -> Graph

Plot the suite dependency graph. The graph viewer updates in real time
as you edit the suite definition. See 'cylc graph --help'.

%h3 Preparation -> Search

Search for strings or regular expressions in the suite.rc file and,
optionally, in the suite bin directory. See 'cylc grep --help'.

%h3 Preparation -> Validate

Parse the suite.rc file and validate it against the suite.rc spec, 
then attempt to instantiate all suite task proxies, and report any
errors. See 'cylc validate --help'.

%h3 Information -> View Suite Log
This opens a searchable and filterable view of the suite log file that
records, timestamped, all important events as the suite runs.

%h3 Information -> View Suite Output
This opens a new view of the suite stdout and stderr files
$HOME/.cylc/NAME.(out|err) used when suites are started from
within cylc db viewer (if you start a suite from the command line,
however, what happens to its stdout and stderr end up is entirely up to
you). The suite remembers task output locations while the corresponding
task proxies still exist in the suite (this information is not stored in 
suite state dump files, however, so it will be lost for finished tasks
still in the suite, if you stop and restart the suite).

%h3 Information -> Dump Suite State (Running suites only)
Print the current state of each task in the suite. 
See 'cylc info dump --help'.

%h3 Database -> Copy
Copy an existing suite (or group of suites) and register it (or them)
for use. See 'cylc db copy --help'.

%h3 Database -> Alias
Create an alias (generally a short nickname) for an existing registered
suite. Referring to a suite via its alias is entirely equivalent to using
the full registered name.  See 'cylc db alias --help'.

%h3 Database -> Reregister
Reregister an existing suite (or group of suites) under a different
name. See 'cylc db register --help'.

%h3 Database -> Unregister
Delete the registration of a suite (or group of suites) and optionally 
delete its (or their) suite definition directory(s).  
See 'cylc db unregister --help'.""")

Change suite visibility by filtering on group and/or name with
(Python-style) regular expressions (so, for example, the
wildcard is '.*' not '*' as in a shell glob expression).

Leaving a filter entry blank is equivalent to '.*' (i.e. match
anything).

Filter patterns have an implicit string start character ('^')
but no implicit string end character ('$'). Examples:

%i foo - matches 'foo' and 'foobar', but not 'barfoo'
%i foo$ - matches 'foo' only
%i .*foo$  - matches 'foo', 'barfoo', but not 'foobar'
%i (?i)foo - case-insensitive (matches 'foo', 'Food', 'FOOb',...)
