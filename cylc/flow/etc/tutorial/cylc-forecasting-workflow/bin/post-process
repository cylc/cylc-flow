Usage:
    post-process SITE TIME

Arguments:
    SITE: The name of the location to process data for.
    TIME: The time ahead of the cycle point to produce the forecast for in
          minutes.

Environment Variables:
    DOMAIN: The area in which to generate forecasts for in the format
        (lng1, lat1, lng2, lat2).
    RESOLUTION: The length/width of each grid cell in degrees.
