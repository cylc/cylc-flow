    """Random xtrigger, with configurable sleep and percent success.

    Sleep for ``sec`` seconds, and report satisfied with ``percent``
    likelihood.

    The ``_`` argument is not used in the function code, but can be used to
    specialize the function signature to cycle point or task.

    Args:
        percent:
            Percent likelihood of passing.
        secs:
            Seconds to sleep before starting the trigger.
        _:
            Used to allow users to specialize the trigger with extra
            parameters.

    Examples:
        If the percent is zero, it returns that the trigger condition was
        not satisfied, and an empty dictionary.

        >>> xrandom(0, 0)
        (False, {})

        If the percent is not zero, but the random percent success is not met,
        then it also returns that the trigger condition was not satisfied,
        and an empty dictionary.

        >>> import sys
        >>> mocked_random = lambda: 0.3
        >>> sys.modules[__name__].random = mocked_random
        >>> xrandom(15.5, 0)
        (False, {})

        Finally, if the percent is not zero, and the random percent success is
        met, then it returns that the trigger condition was satisfied, and a
        dictionary containing random colour and size as result.

        >>> import sys
        >>> mocked_random = lambda: 0.9
        >>> sys.modules[__name__].random = mocked_random
        >>> mocked_randint = lambda x, y: 1
        >>> sys.modules[__name__].randint = mocked_randint
        >>> xrandom(99.99, 0)
        (True, {'COLOR': 'orange', 'SIZE': 'small'})

    Returns:
        tuple: (satisfied, results)

        satisfied:
            True if ``satisfied`` else ``False``.
        results:
            A dictionary containing the following keys:

            ``COLOR``
                A random colour (e.g. red, orange, ...).
            ``SIZE``
                A random size (e.g. small, medium, ...).
