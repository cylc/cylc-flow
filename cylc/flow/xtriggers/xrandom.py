    """Random xtrigger, with configurable sleep and percent success.

    Sleep for <sec> seconds, and report satisfied with ~<percent> likelihood.
    If satisfied, return a random color and size as the result.
    The '_' argument is not used in the function code, but can be used to
    specialize the function signature to cycle point or task.

    If the percent is zero, it returns that the trigger condition was
    not satisfied, and an empty dictionary.
    >>> xrandom(0, 0)
    (False, {})

    If the percent is not zero, but the random percent success is not met,
    then it also returns that the trigger condition was not satisfied,
    and an empty dictionary.

    >>> mocked_random = lambda: 0.3
    >>> sys.modules[__name__].random = mocked_random
    >>> xrandom(15.5, 0)
    (False, {})

    Finally, if the percent is not zero, and the random percent success is
    met, then it returns that the trigger condition was satisfied, and a
    dictionary containing random color and size as result.
    >>> import sys
    >>> mocked_random = lambda: 0.9
    >>> sys.modules[__name__].random = mocked_random

    >>> xrandom(99.99, 0)
    (True, {'COLOR': 'orange', 'SIZE': 'small'})

    Args:
        percent (float): percent likelihood.
        secs (int): seconds to sleep before starting the trigger.
        _ (object): used to allow users to specialize the trigger
                    with extra parameters.
        debug (bool): flag to enable debug information.
    Returns:
        A tuple with the trigger flag (bool) which is set to True if the
        trigger was evaluated successful, False otherwise, and a random
        color and size (dict).
