    Arguments:
        suite (str):
            The suite to interrogate.
        task (str):
            The name of the task to query.
        offset (str):
            The offset between the cycle this xtrigger is used in and the one
            it is querying for as an ISO8601 time duration.
            e.g. PT1H (one hour).
        status (str):
            The task status required for this xtrigger to be satisfied.
        message (str):
            The custom task output required for this xtrigger to be satisfied.

               This cannot be specified in conjunction with ``status``.

        cylc_run_dir (str):
            The directory in which the suite to interrogate.

               different location to what is specified in the global
               configuration (usually ``~/cylc-run``).

        debug (bool):
            Flag to enable debug information.

    Returns:
        tuple: (satisfied, results)

        satisfied (bool):

        results (dict):
