"""cylc set-outputs [OPTIONS] ARGS

Artificially mark task outputs as completed and spawn downstream tasks that
depend on those outputs. By default it marks tasks as succeeded.

This allows you to manually intervene with Cylc's scheduling algorithm by
artificially satisfying outputs of tasks.

If a flow number is given, the child tasks will start (or continue) that flow.

Examples:
  # For example, for the following dependency graph:
  R1 = '''
     a => b & c => d
     foo:x => bar => baz
  '''

  # spawn 1/b and 1/c, but 1/d will not subsequently run
  $ cylc set-outputs my_flow//1/a

  # spawn 1/b and 1/c as flow 2, followed by 1/d
  $ cylc set-outputs --flow=2 my_flow//1/a

  # spawn 1/bar as flow 3, followed by 1/baz
  $ cylc set-outputs --flow=3 --output=x my_flow//1/foo

Use --output multiple times to spawn off of several outputs at once.
