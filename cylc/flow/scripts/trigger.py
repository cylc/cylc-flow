"""cylc trigger [OPTIONS] ARGS

Force tasks to run regardless of prerequisites.

* Triggering an unqueued waiting task queues it, regardless of prerequisites.
* Triggering a queued task submits it, regardless of queue limiting.
* Triggering an active task has no effect (it already triggered).

Examples:
  # trigger task foo in cycle 1234 in test
  $ cylc trigger test//1234/foo

  # trigger all failed tasks in test
  $ cylc trigger 'test//*:failed'

  # start a new flow by triggering 1234/foo in test
  $ cylc trigger --flow=new test//1234/foo

Flows:
  Active tasks (in the n=0 window) already belong to a flow.
  * by default, if triggered, they run in the same flow
  * or with --flow=all, they are assigned all active flows
  * or with --flow=INT or --flow=new, the original and new flows are merged
  * (--flow=none is ignored for active tasks)

  Inactive tasks (n>0) do not already belong to a flow.
  * by default they are assigned all active flows
  * otherwise, they are assigned the --flow value

  Note --flow=new increments the global flow counter with each use. If it
  takes multiple commands to start a new flow use the actual flow number
  after the first command (you can read it from the scheduler log).
