"""cylc trigger [OPTIONS] ARGS

Force tasks to run regardless of prerequisites.

* Triggering an unqueued waiting task queues it, regardless of prerequisites.
* Triggering a queued task submits it, regardless of queue limiting.
* Triggering an active task has no effect (it already triggered).

Future tasks (n>0) do not already belong to a flow.
* by default they are assigned to all active flows
* otherwise, according to the --flow option

Active tasks (n=0) already belong to a flow.
* by default they run in the same flow
* with --flow=all, they are assigned to all active flows
* with --flow=INT or --flow=new, the new flow merges with the old one
* --flow=none is ignored, to avoid blocking the existing flow

Note --flow=new increments the global flow counter so if you need multiple
commands to start a single new flow only use --flow=new in the first command,
then use the actual new flow number (e.g. read it from the scheduler log).

Examples:
  # trigger task foo in cycle 1234 in test
  $ cylc trigger test//1234/foo

  # trigger all failed tasks in test
  $ cylc trigger 'test//*:failed'

  # start a new flow by triggering 1234/foo in test
  $ cylc trigger --flow=new test//1234/foo
