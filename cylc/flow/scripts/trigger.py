"""cylc trigger [OPTIONS] ARGS

Force tasks to run despite unsatisfied prerequisites.

* Triggering an unqueued waiting task queues it, regardless of prerequisites.
* Triggering a queued task submits it, regardless of queue limiting.
* Triggering an active task has no effect (it already triggered).

Incomplete and active-waiting tasks in the n=0 window already belong to a flow.
Triggering them queues them to run (or rerun) in the same flow.

Beyond n=0, triggered tasks get all current active flow numbers by default, or
specified flow numbers via the --flow option. Those flows - if/when they catch
up - will see tasks that ran after triggering event as having run already.

Examples:
  # trigger task foo in cycle 1234 in test
  $ cylc trigger test//1234/foo

  # trigger all failed tasks in test
  $ cylc trigger 'test//*:failed'

  # start a new flow by triggering 1234/foo in test
  $ cylc trigger --flow=new test//1234/foo
