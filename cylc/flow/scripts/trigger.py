"""cylc trigger [OPTIONS] ARGS

Manually trigger tasks, respecting dependencies among them.

Triggering individual tasks:
  * Triggering an unqueued task queues it; triggering a queued task runs it;
    so to run an unqueued task immediately you many need to trigger it twice.
  * Tasks can be triggered to run even if the workflow is paused.
  * Attempts to live tasks (preparing, submitted, running) will be ignored.

Triggering a group of multiple tasks at once:
  To run or rerun a sub-graph, Cylc will automatically:
  * erase the run history of the tasks, to allow re-run in the same flow
  * identify "start tasks" that lead into the sub-graph and trigger them
  * identify dependencies outside the group and satisfy them, to avoid a stall
  * leave dependencies within the group to be satisfied by the triggered flow

  If the workflow is paused, group start tasks will trigger immediately. The
  flow will continue on from them when the workflow resumes.

  How live (preparing, submitted, running) group members are handled:
  * live group start tasks are left to run - they already triggered
    WARNING: if they already completed outputs that other group tasks depend
    on, you must manually satisfy ("cylc set") those prerequisites again
  * live group-internal tasks are killed, so they can re-run in the flow

Examples:
  # trigger task foo in cycle 1, in workflow "test"
  $ cylc trigger test//1/foo

  # trigger all failed tasks in workflow "test"
  $ cylc trigger 'test//*:failed'  # (quotes required)

  # start a new flow from 1/foo
  # (beware of off-flow prerequisites downstream of 1/foo)
  $ cylc trigger --flow=new test//1/foo

  # rerun sub-graph "a => b & c" in the same flow, ignoring "off => b"
  $ cylc trigger test //1/a //1/b //1/c

 Flow numbers of triggered tasks are determined as follows:
  Active tasks (n=0) already have existing flow numbers.
   * default: merge active and existing flow numbers
   * --flow=INT or "new": merge given and existing flow numbers
   * --flow="none": ERROR (not valid for already-active tasks)
  Inactive tasks (n>0) do not have flow numbers assigned:
   * default: run with all active flow numbers
   * --flow=INT or "new": run with the given flow numbers
   * --flow="none": run as no-flow (activity will not flow on downstream)
