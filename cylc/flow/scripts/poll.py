"""cylc poll [OPTIONS] ARGS

Poll (query) task jobs to verify and update their statuses.

This checks the job status file and queries the job runner on the job platform.

Pollable tasks are those in the n=0 window with an associated job ID,
including incomplete finished tasks.

Examples:
  # poll all pollable tasks in my_flow
  $ cylc poll 'my_flow//*'

  # poll specific tasks in my_flow
  $ cylc poll my_flow// //1/a //1/b
