"""cylc get-resources [OPTIONS] ARGS

Extract resources from the cylc.flow package.

If the directory is omitted the resource will be copied either to your
current working directory for regular resources, or to the first configured
"source" directory (~/cylc-src by default) for the tutorials.

Examples:
    # list all resources
    $ cylc get-resources --list

    # copy the Cylc wrapper script to the current directory:
    $ cylc get-resources cylc

    # copy the Cylc wrapper script to a/b/c:
    $ cylc get-resources cylc a/b/c

    # copy the "runtime-tutorial" to your "source" directory:
    $ cylc get-resources tutorial/runtime-tutorial

    # copy all of the tutorials to your "source" directory:
    $ cylc get-resources tutorial"""
