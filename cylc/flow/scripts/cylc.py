  $ cylc trigger SUITE TASK       # trigger TASK in SUITE
  $ cylc trig SUITE TASK          # ditto

Task Identification:
  Tasks are identified by NAME.CYCLE_POINT where POINT is either a
  date-time or an integer.

  Date-time cycle points are in an ISO 8601 date-time format, typically
  CCYYMMDDThhmm followed by a time zone - e.g. 20101225T0600Z.

  Integer cycle points (including those for one-off suites) are integers
  - just '1' for one-off suites.
