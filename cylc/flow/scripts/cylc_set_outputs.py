"""cylc set-outputs [OPTIONS] REG TASK-GLOB [...]

Override the outputs of tasks in a running suite.

Tell the scheduler that specified outputs (the "succeeded" output by default)
of tasks are complete.

Downstream tasks will be spawned or updated just as if the outputs were
completed normally.

The --output=OUTPUT option can be used multiple times on the command line.
