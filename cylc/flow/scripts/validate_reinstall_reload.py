"""cylc validate-reinstall-reload/play [OPTIONS] ARGS

Validate and install a single workflow. Then if:
- Workflow running => reload.
- Workflow paused => resume.
- Workflow stopped => play.

This script is equivalent to:

    $ cylc validate myworkflow --against-source     # See note 1
    $ cylc reinstall myworkflow

    $ if [[ my workflow is running ]];
          cylc reload myworkflow
      else
          cylc play myworkflow

Note 1:

Cylc validate myworkflow --against-source is eqivelent of (It doesn't write
any temporary files though):

    # Install from run directory
    $ cylc install ~/cylc-run/myworkflow -n temporary
    # Install from source directory over the top
    $ cylc install /path/to/myworkflow -n temporary
    # Validate combined config
    $ cylc validate ~/cylc-run/temporary
