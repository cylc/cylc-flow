"""cylc [control] trigger [OPTIONS] ARGS

Manually trigger tasks.
  cylc trigger REG - trigger all tasks in a running workflow
  cylc trigger REG TASK_GLOB ... - trigger some tasks in a running workflow

NOTE waiting tasks that are queue-limited will be queued if triggered, to
submit as normal when released by the queue; queued tasks will submit
immediately if triggered, even if that violates the queue limit (so you may
need to trigger a queue-limited task twice to get it to submit immediately).
