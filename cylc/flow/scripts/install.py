"""cylc install [OPTIONS] ARGS

Install a workflow into ~/cylc-run.

The workflow can then be started, stopped, and targeted by name.

Normal installation creates a numbered run directory
"~/cylc-run/<workflow-name>/run<number>".

If a SOURCE_NAME is supplied, Cylc will search for the workflow source in the
list of directories given by "global.cylc[install]source dirs", and install
the first match. The installed workflow name will be the same as SOURCE_NAME,
unless --workflow-name is used.

If a PATH is supplied, Cylc will install the workflow from the source directory
given by the path. Relative paths must start with "./" to avoid ambiguity with
SOURCE_NAME (i.e. "foo/bar" will be interpreted as a source name, whereas
"./foo/bar" will be interpreted as a path). The installed workflow name will
be the basename of the path, unless --workflow-name is used.

If no argument is supplied, Cylc will install the workflow from the source
in the current working directory.

A "_cylc-install/source" symlink to the source directory will be created in
"~/cylc-run/<workflow-name>". Any files or directories (excluding .git, .svn)
from the source directory are copied to the new run directory. A ".service"
directory will also be created in the run directory; this is used for server
authentication files at runtime.

Examples:
  # Install workflow "dogs/fido" from the first match in
  # `global.cylc[install]source dirs`, e.g. ~/cylc-src/dogs/fido/flow.cylc,
  # with run directory ~/cylc-run/dogs/fido/run1 (if "run1" already exists,
  # this will increment)
  $ cylc install dogs/fido

  # Install $PWD as "rabbit", if $PWD is ~/bunny/rabbit, with
  # run directory ~/cylc-run/rabbit/run1
  $ cylc install

  # Install $PWD as "rabbit", if $PWD is ~/bunny/rabbit, with
  # run directory ~/cylc-run/rabbit (note: no "run1" sub-directory)
  $ cylc install --no-run-name

  # Install $PWD as "fido", regardless of what $PWD is called, with
  # run directory ~/cylc-run/fido/run1
  $ cylc install --workflow-name=fido

  # Install $PWD/bunny/rabbit/ as "rabbit", with run directory
  # ~/cylc-run/rabbit/run1
  $ cylc install ./bunny/rabbit

  # Install /home/somewhere/badger as "badger", with run directory
  # ~/cylc-run/badger/run1
  $ cylc install /home/somewhere/badger

  # Install $PWD as "cats", if $PWD is ~/cats, with run directory
  # ~/cylc-run/cats/paws
  $ cylc install --run-name=paws

The same workflow can be installed with multiple names; this results in
multiple workflow run directories that link to the same workflow definition.
