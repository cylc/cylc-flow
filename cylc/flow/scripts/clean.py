"""cylc clean [OPTIONS] ARGS

Remove a stopped workflow from the local scheduler filesystem and remote hosts.

NOTE: this command is intended for workflows installed with `cylc install`. If
this is run for a workflow that was instead written directly in ~/cylc-run and
not backed up elsewhere, it will be lost.

It will also remove any symlink directory targets.

Workflow names can be hierarchical, corresponding to the path under ~/cylc-run.

Examples:
  # Remove the workflow at ~/cylc-run/foo/bar
  $ cylc clean foo/bar
