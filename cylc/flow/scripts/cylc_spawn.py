"""cylc [control] spawn [OPTIONS] ARGS

Force task proxies to spawn successors at their own next cycle point.
  cylc spawn REG - force spawn all tasks in a workflow
  cylc spawn REG TASK_GLOB ... - force spawn one or more tasks in a workflow

Tasks normally spawn on reaching the "submitted" status. Spawning them early
allows running successive instances of the same task out of order. See also
the "spawn to max active cycle points" workflow configuration.
