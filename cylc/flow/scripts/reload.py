"""cylc reload [OPTIONS] ARGS

Reload the configuration of a running workflow.

Example:
  # install and run the workflow
  $ cylc install
  $ cylc play my_workflow

  # make changes to the workflow source directory

  # reinstall the workflow
  $ cylc reinstall my_workflow

  # reload the workflow to pick up changes
  $ cylc reload my_workflow
  # the workflow is now running with the new config

All settings including task definitions, with the exception of workflow log
config, can be changed on reload. Changes to task definitions take effect
immediately, unless a task is already running at reload time.

Upon reload, remote file installation will be triggered for all relevant
platforms on the next job submit. Any changed files that are configured to be
included in the file installation will be transferred to the appropriate remote
platform(s).

If the workflow was started with Jinja2 template variables set on the command
line (cylc play --set 'FOO="bar"' WORKFLOW_ID) the same template settings apply
to the reload (only changes to the flow.cylc file itself are reloaded).

If the modified workflow definition does not parse, failure to reload will
be reported but no harm will be done to the running workflow.
