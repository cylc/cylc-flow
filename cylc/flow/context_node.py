class ContextNode():
    """A class for defining nested objects.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            The key identifier for this node.
            Nodes belonging to the same parent must have not have the same
            name.

    Examples:
        Define the tree:
        >>> with ContextNode('a') as a:
        ...     # create parent nodes using a context
        ...     # manager
        ...     with ContextNode('b') as b:
        ...         # create "leaf" nodes without
        ...         # a context manager
        ...         c = ContextNode('c')
        ...     d = ContextNode('d')

        The "key" for this node:
        >>> str(c)
        'c'
        >>> repr(c)
        'a/b/c'

        List ancestry:
        >>> list(c.parents())
        [a/b, a]

        Iterate through children:
        >>> list(a)
        [a/b, a/d]

        Summarise the tree:
        >>> print(a.tree())
        a
            b
                c
            d

    Node Terminology:
        Root/

            Leaf

            string. Can use any of the instance attributes.
        ROOT_NAME_FMT (str):
            String representation for parent nodes.
        ROOT_NAME_FMT (str):
            String representation for leaf nodes.
