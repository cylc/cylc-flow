.. cylc-scope:: flow.cylc[runtime][<namespace>]

Uses the ``sbatch`` command. SLURM directives can be provided in the flow.cylc
file:

.. code-block:: cylc
   :caption: global.cylc

   [platforms]
       [[slurm_platform]]
           job runner = slurm

.. code-block:: cylc
   :caption: flow.cylc

   [runtime]
       [[my_task]]
           platform = slurm_platform
           execution time limit = PT1H
           [[[directives]]]
               --nodes = 5
               --account = QXZ5W2

.. note::

   * Cylc requires long form directives (e.g. ``--begin`` not ``-b``).
   * Cylc requires an ``=`` even if the directive does not have a value
     (e.g. ``--hold=`` not ``--hold``).
   * If a directive does not have a value you may use the short form
     (e.g. ``-H=``). But the directive must still be suffixed with an ``=``.

These are written to the top of the job script like this:

.. code-block:: bash

   #!/bin/bash
   #SBATCH --nodes=5
   #SBATCH --time=60:00
   #SBATCH --account=QXZ5W2

If :cylc:conf:`execution time limit` is specified, it is used to generate the
``--time`` directive. Do not specify the ``--time`` directive explicitly if
:cylc:conf:`execution time limit` is specified.  Otherwise, the execution time
limit known by the workflow may be out of sync with what is submitted to the
job runner.

Cylc supports heterogeneous Slurm jobs via special numbered directive prefixes
that distinguish repeated directives from one another:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [runtime]
       # run two heterogenous job components:
       script = srun sleep 10 : sleep 30
       [[my_task]]
           execution time limit = PT1H
           platform = slurm_platform
           [[[directives]]]
               --account = QXZ5W2
               hetjob_0_--mem = 1G  # first prefix must be "0"
               hetjob_0_--nodes = 3
               hetjob_1_--mem = 2G
               hetjob_1_--nodes = 6

The resulting formatted directives are:

.. code-block:: bash

   #!/bin/bash
   #SBATCH --time=60:00
   #SBATCH --account=QXZ5W2
   #SBATCH --mem=1G
   #SBATCH --nodes=3
   #SBATCH hetjob
   #SBATCH --mem=2G
   #SBATCH --nodes=6

.. note::

   For older Slurm versions with *packjob* instead of *hetjob*, use
   :cylc:conf:`global.cylc[platforms][<platform name>]job runner =
   slurm_packjob` and directive prefixes ``packjob_0_`` etc.
