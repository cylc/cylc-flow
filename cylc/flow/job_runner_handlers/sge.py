"""Submits job scripts to Sun/Oracle Grid Engine with ``qsub``.

.. cylc-scope:: flow.cylc[runtime][<namespace>]

SGE directives can be provided in the flow.cylc file:

.. code-block:: cylc
   :caption: global.cylc

   [platforms]
       [[sge_platform]]
           job runner = sge

.. code-block:: cylc
   :caption: flow.cylc

   [runtime]
       [[my_task]]
           platform = sge_platform
           execution time limit = P1D
           [[[directives]]]
               -cwd =
               -q = foo
               -l h_data = 1024M
               -l h_rt = 24:00:00

These are written to the top of the job script like this:

.. code-block:: bash

   #!/bin/bash
   # DIRECTIVES
   #$ -cwd
   #$ -q foo
   #$ -l h_data=1024M
   #$ -l h_rt=24:00:00

If :cylc:conf:`execution time limit` is specified, it is used to generate the
``-l h_rt`` directive. Do not specify the ``-l h_rt`` directive explicitly if
:cylc:conf:`execution time limit` is specified.  Otherwise, the execution time
limit known by the workflow may be out of sync with what is submitted to the
job runner.
