"""Functionality for searching for workflows running as the current user.

The :py:func:`scan` asynchronous generator yields workflows. Iterate
over them using an ``async for`` statement::

    async for flow in scan():
        print(flow['name'])

For further functionality construct a pipe::

    pipe = scan | is_active(True) | contact_info
    async for flow in pipe:
        print(f'{flow["name"]} {flow["CYLC_SUITE_HOST"]}')

There are filters which you can you to omit workflows e.g.
:py:func:`cylc_version` and transformers which acquire more information
e.g. :py:func:`contact_info`.

.. note: we must manually list functions so they get built into the docs

.. autofunction:: scan
.. autofunction:: filter_name
.. autofunction:: is_active
.. autofunction:: contact_info
.. autofunction:: cylc_version
.. autofunction:: api_version
.. autofunction:: graphql_query
