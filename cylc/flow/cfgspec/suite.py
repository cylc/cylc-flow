                how multiple graphs combine.

        This section is used to specify how, where, and what to execute when
        tasks are ready to run. Common configuration can be factored out in a
        multiple-inheritance hierarchy of runtime namespaces that culminates
        in the tasks of the suite. Order of precedence is determined by the C3
        linearization algorithm as used to find the *method resolution order*
        in Python language class hierarchies. For details and examples see
        :ref:`NIORP`.

            the suite. Names may contain letters, digits, underscores, and
            hyphens.  A namespace represents a group or family of tasks if
            other namespaces inherit from it, or a task if no others inherit
            from it.

            Names may not contain colons (which would preclude use of
            directory paths involving the registration name in ``$PATH``
            variables). They may not contain the "." character (it will be
            interpreted as the namespace hierarchy delimiter, separating
            groups and names -huh?).

            legal values:

            - ``[foo]``
            - ``[foo, bar, baz]``

            If multiple names are listed the subsequent settings apply to
            each.

                Task job scripts are executed from within *work directories*

                (or simply ``$PWD`` if it does not ``cd`` elsewhere at
                runtime). The default directory path contains task name and
                cycle point, to provide a unique workspace for every instance
                of every task. If several tasks need to exchange files and
                simply read and write from their from current working
                directory, this item can be used to override the default to
                make them all use the same workspace.

                The top level share and work directory location can be changed
                (e.g. to a large data area) by a global config setting (see

                   If you omit cycle point from the work sub-directory path
                   successive instances of the task will share the same
                   workspace. Consider the effect on cycle point offset
                   housekeeping of work directories before doing this.

                Example:

                well-designed inheritance hierarchy that provides each task
                with just the variables it needs.* Filters can, however,
                improve suites with tasks that inherit a lot of environment
                they don't need, by making it clear which tasks use which
                variables.  They can optionally be used routinely as explicit
                "task environment interfaces" too, at some cost to brevity,
                because they guarantee that variables filtered out of the
                inherited task environment are not used.

                   Environment filtering is done after inheritance is
                   completely worked out, not at each level on the way, so

                handlers; see :cylc:conf:`suite.rc[cylc][events]` for
                suite event handlers.

                Event handlers can be located in the suite ``bin/`` directory,
                otherwise it is up to you to ensure their location is in
                ``$PATH`` (in the shell in which the suite server program
                runs). They should require little resource to run and return
                quickly.

                Each task event handler can be specified as a list of command
                lines or command line templates. They can contain any or all
                of the following patterns, which will be substituted with
                actual values:

                   ``%(URL)s``
                      Task URL
                   ``%(importance)s``

                      Suite URL.
                   ``%(suite_rating)s``
                      Example custom suite metadata.

                   Substitution patterns should not be quoted in the template
                   strings.  This is done automatically where required.

                    variables. Values are passed through to the task job
                    script without evaluation or manipulation by cylc, so any
                    variable assignment expression that is legal in the job
                    submission shell can be used.  White space around the

                    concerned these are just normal configuration items).
