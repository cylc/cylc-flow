    The global configuration which defines default Cylc Flow settings
    for a user or site.

    To view your global config run::

       $ cylc get-global-config --sparse

    Cylc will attempt to load the global configuration (``global.cylc``) from a
    hierarchy of locations, including the site directory (defaults to
    ``/etc/cylc/flow/``) and the user directory (``~/.cylc/flow/``). E.g. for
    Cylc version 8.0.1, the hierarchy would be, in order of ascending priority:

    * ``${CYLC_SITE_CONF_PATH}/global.cylc``
    * ``${CYLC_SITE_CONF_PATH}/8/global.cylc``
    * ``${CYLC_SITE_CONF_PATH}/8.0/global.cylc``
    * ``${CYLC_SITE_CONF_PATH}/8.0.1/global.cylc``
    * ``~/.cylc/flow/global.cylc``
    * ``~/.cylc/flow/8/global.cylc``
    * ``~/.cylc/flow/8.0/global.cylc``
    * ``~/.cylc/flow/8.0.1/global.cylc``

    A setting in a file lower down in the list will override the same setting
    from those higher up (but if a setting is present in a file higher up and
    not in any files lower down, it will not be overridden).

    Setting the ``CYLC_SITE_CONF_PATH`` environment variable overrides the
    default value of ``/etc/cylc/flow/``.

    To override the entire hierarchy, set the ``CYLC_CONF_PATH`` environment
    variable to the directory containing your ``global.cylc`` file.

    .. note::

       The ``global.cylc`` file can be templated using Jinja2 variables.
       See :ref:`Jinja`.

    .. note::

       Prior to Cylc 8, ``global.cylc`` was named ``global.rc``, but that name
       is no longer supported.

                Routine polling is done only for the polling *task
                communication method* (below) unless suite-specific polling is

                near the beginning and end of the anticipated task run time.
