Example::

    The global configuration which defines default Cylc Flow settings
    for a user or site.

    To view your global config, run::

       $ cylc config

    Cylc will attempt to load the global configuration (``global.cylc``) from a
    hierarchy of locations, including the site directory (defaults to
    ``/etc/cylc/flow/``) and the user directory (``~/.cylc/flow/``). For
    example at Cylc version 8.0.1, the hierarchy would be, in order of
    ascending priority:

    .. code-block:: sub

       <site-conf-path>/flow/global.cylc
       <site-conf-path>/flow/8/global.cylc
       <site-conf-path>/flow/8.0/global.cylc
       <site-conf-path>/flow/8.0.1/global.cylc
       ~/.cylc/flow/global.cylc
       ~/.cylc/flow/8/global.cylc
       ~/.cylc/flow/8.0/global.cylc
       ~/.cylc/flow/8.0.1/global.cylc

    Where ``<site-conf-path>`` is ``/etc/cylc/flow/`` by default but can be
    changed by :envvar:`CYLC_SITE_CONF_PATH`.

    A setting in a file lower down in the list will override the same setting
    from those higher up (but if a setting is present in a file higher up and
    not in any files lower down, it will not be overridden).

    The following environment variables can change the files which are loaded:

    .. envvar:: CYLC_CONF_PATH

       If set this bypasses the default site/user configuration hierarchy used
       to load the Cylc Flow global configuration.

       This should be set to a directory containing a :cylc:conf:`global.cylc`
       file.

    .. envvar:: CYLC_SITE_CONF_PATH

       By default the site configuration is located in ``/etc/cylc/``. For
       installations where this is not convenient, this path can be overridden
       by setting ``CYLC_SITE_CONF_PATH`` to point at another location.

       Configuration for different Cylc components should be in sub-directories
       within this location.

       For example to configure Cylc Flow you could do the following::

          $CYLC_SITE_CONF_PATH/
          `-- flow/
              `-- global.cylc

    .. note::

       The ``global.cylc`` file can be templated using Jinja2 variables.
       See :ref:`Jinja`.

    .. versionchanged:: 8.0.0

       Prior to Cylc 8, ``global.cylc`` was named ``global.rc``, but that name
       is no longer supported.

        Platforms allow you to define compute resources available at your
        site.

        A platform consists of a group of one or more hosts which share a
        file system and a job runner (batch system).

        A platform must allow interaction with the same job from *any*
        of its hosts.

        .. versionadded:: 8.0.0
    '''):
        with Conf('<platform name>', desc='''
            Configuration defining a platform.

            Many of these settings have replaced those of the same name from
            the old Cylc 7 ``suite.rc[runtime][<namespace>][job]/[remote]``
            and ``global.rc[hosts][<host>]`` sections.

            Platform names can be regular expressions: If you have a set of
            compute resources such as ``bigmachine1, bigmachine2`` or
            ``desktop0000, .., desktop9999`` one would define platforms with
            names ``[[bigmachine[12]]]`` and ``[[desktop[0-9]{4}]]``.

            Cylc searches for a matching platform in the reverse
            of the definition order to allow user defined platforms
            to override site defined platforms. This means, for example, that
            if ``[[a.*]]`` were set at the bottom of a configuration any
            platform name beginning with "a" would return that platform.

            .. note::

               Each possible match to the definition regular expression is
               considered a separate platform.

               If you had a supercomputer with multiple login nodes this would
               be a single platform with multiple :cylc:conf:`hosts`.

            .. warning::

               ``[platforms][localhost]`` may be set, to override default
               settings, but regular expressions which match "localhost"
               may not. Use comma separated lists instead:

               .. code-block:: cylc

                Whether to use a login shell or not for remote command
                invocation.

                By default, Cylc runs remote SSH commands using a login shell:

                .. code-block:: bash

                   ssh user@host 'bash --login cylc ...'

                which will source the following files (in order):

                * ``/etc/profile``
                * ``~/.bash_profile``
                * ``~/.bash_login``
                * ``~/.profile``

                For more information on login shells see the "Invocation"
                section of the `Bash man pages`_.

                For security reasons some institutions do not allow unattended
                commands to start login shells, so you can turn off this
                behaviour to get:

                .. code-block:: bash

                   ssh user@host 'cylc ...'

                which will use the default shell on the remote machine,
                sourcing ``~/.bashrc`` (or ``~/.cshrc``) to set up the
                environment.

                The path containing the ``cylc`` executable on a remote

                This may be necessary if the ``cylc`` executable is not in the
                ``$PATH`` for an ``ssh`` call.
                Test whether this is the case by using
                ``ssh <host> command -v cylc``.

                This path is used for remote invocations of the ``cylc``
                command and is added to the ``$PATH`` in job scripts
                for the configured platform.

                .. note::

                   If :cylc:conf:`[..]use login shell = True` (the default)
                   then an alternative approach is to add ``cylc`` to the
                   ``$PATH`` in the system or user Bash profile files
                   (e.g. ``~/.bash_profile``).

                   For multi-version installations this should point to the
                   Cylc wrapper script rather than the ``cylc`` executable

                Job submission subprocesses inherit their parent environment by
                default. Remote jobs inherit the default non-interactive shell
                environment for their platform. Jobs on the scheduler host
                inherit the scheduler environment (unless their job runner
                prevents this).

                If, for example, the ``$PYTHON`` variable is different on the
                scheduler and the remote host the same program  may run in
                different ways.

                We recommend using a clean job submission environment for
                consistent handling of local and remote jobs. However,
                this is not the default behaviour because it prevents
                local jobs from running, unless ``$PATH`` contains the
                ``cylc`` wrapper script.

                Specific environment variables can be singled out to pass
                through to the clean environment, if necessary.

                A standard set of executable paths is passed through to clean
                environments, and can be added to if necessary.

        For example, if you have a group of computers
        without a shared file system, but otherwise identical called
        ``bigmachine01..02`` you might set up a platform group
        ``[[bigmachines]]platforms=bigmachine01, bigmachine02``.
