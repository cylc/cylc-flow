               And include the server.key file (from the .service
               directory), this is required for authentication.

               These should be located in the top level of your Cylc workflow,
               i.e. the directory that contains your flow.cylc file.

            Directories must have a trailing slash.

            :term:`cycle points<cycle point>` in :term:`datetime cycling`
            workflows.

            To alter the timezone used in the date-time cycle point
            format, see :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc[scheduler]cycle point time zone`.
            To alter the number of expanded year digits (for years
            below 0 or above 9999), see
            :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc
            [scheduler]cycle point num expanded year digits`.

            Cylc usually uses a ``CCYYMMDDThhmmZ`` (``Z`` in the special
            case of UTC) or ``CCYYMMDDThhmmÂ±hhmm`` format for writing
            date-time cycle points, following the :term:`ISO8601` standard.

            You may use the `isodatetime library's syntax
            <https://github.com/metomi/isodatetime#dates-and-times>`_ to set
            the cycle point format, as demonstrated in the previous paragraph.

            You can also use a subset of the strptime/strftime POSIX
            standard - supported tokens are ``%F``, ``%H``, ``%M``, ``%S``,
            ``%Y``, ``%d``, ``%j``, ``%m``, ``%s``, ``%z``.

            The time zone you specify here will be used only for
            writing/dumping cycle points. Cycle points that are input without
            time zones will still default to the local time zone unless
            :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc[scheduler]cycle point time zone` or
            :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc[scheduler]UTC mode` are set. Not specifying a
            time zone here is inadvisable as it leads to ambiguity.

            .. note::

               The ISO8601 extended date-time format can be used
               (``CCYY-MM-DDThh:mm``) but note that the "-" and ":" characters
               end up in job log directory paths.

        Conf('cycle point num expanded year digits', VDR.V_INTEGER, 0, desc='''
            For years below 0 or above 9999, the ISO 8601 standard specifies
            that an extra number of year digits and a sign should be used.
            This extra number needs to be written down somewhere (here).

            For example, if this extra number is set to 2, 00Z on the 1st of
            January in the year 10040 will be represented as
            ``+0100400101T0000Z`` (2 extra year digits used). With this number
            set to 3, 06Z on the 4th of May 1985 would be written as
            ``+00019850504T0600Z``.

            This number defaults to 0 (no sign or extra digits used).
        ''')
        Conf('cycle point time zone', VDR.V_CYCLE_POINT_TIME_ZONE, desc='''
            You may set your own time zone choice here, which will be used for
            date-time cycle point dumping and inferring the time zone of cycle
            points that are input without time zones.

            Time zones should be expressed as :term:`ISO8601` time zone offsets
            from UTC, such as ``+13``, ``+1300``, ``-0500`` or ``+0645``,
            with ``Z`` representing the special ``+0000`` case. Cycle points
            will be converted to the time zone you give and will be
            represented with this string at the end.

            If this isn't set (and :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc[scheduler]UTC mode`
            is also not set), then it will default to the local time zone at
            the time of running the workflow. This will persist over local time
            zone changes (e.g. if the workflow is run during winter time, then
            stopped, then restarted after summer time has begun, the cycle
            points will remain in winter time).

            If this isn't set, and UTC mode is set to True, then this will
            default to ``Z``. If you use a custom
            :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc[scheduler]cycle point format`, it is a good
            idea to set the same time zone here. If you specify a different
            one here, it will only be used for inferring timezone-less cycle
            points, while dumping will use the one from the cycle point format.

            .. note::

               It is not recommended to write the time zone with a ":"
               (e.g. ``+05:30``), given that the time zone is used as part of
               task output filenames.

            Runahead limiting prevents the fastest tasks in a workflow from
            getting too far ahead of the slowest ones, as documented in
            :ref:`RunaheadLimit`.

            This limit on the number of consecutive spawned cycle points is
            specified by an interval between the least and most recent: either
            an integer (e.g. ``P3`` -  works for both :term:`integer cycling`
            and :term:`datetime cycling`), or a time interval (e.g. ``PT12H`` -
            only works for datetime cycling). Alternatively, if a raw number is
            given, e.g. ``7``, it will be taken to mean ``PT7H``, though this
            usage is deprecated.

            .. note::

               The integer limit format is irrespective of the labelling of
               cycle points. For example, if the runahead limit is ``P3`` and
               you have a workflow *solely* consisting of a task that repeats
               "every four cycles", it would still spawn three consecutive
               cycle points at a time (starting with 1, 5 and 9). This is
               because the workflow is functionally equivalent to one where the
               task repeats every cycle.

            .. note::

               The runahead limit may be automatically raised if this is
               necessary to allow a future task to be triggered, preventing
               the workflow from stalling.

                   Is equivalent to this:

                with just the variables it needs.* Filters can, however,
                improve workflows with tasks that inherit a lot of environment
                they don't need, by making it clear which tasks use which
                variables.  They can optionally be used routinely as explicit
                "task environment interfaces" too, at some cost to brevity,
                because they guarantee that variables filtered out of the
                inherited task environment are not used.

                .. note::
                   Environment filtering is done after inheritance is
                   completely worked out, not at each level on the way, so
                   filter lists in higher-level namespaces only have an effect

                handlers; see :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc[scheduler][events]` for
                workflow event handlers.

                Event handlers can be held in the workflow ``bin/`` directory,
                otherwise it is up to you to ensure their location is in
                ``$PATH`` (in the shell in which the scheduler runs).
                They should require little resource to run and return
                quickly.

                Each task event handler can be specified as a list of command
                lines or command line templates. They can contain any or all

                    For parameter environment templates, use Python string
                    templates for parameter substitution. This is only
                    relevant for
                    :ref:`parameterized tasks <User Guide Param>`.
                    The job script will export the named variables specified
                    here (in addition to the standard ``CYLC_TASK_PARAM_<key>``
                    variables), with the template strings substituted with
                    the parameter values.
