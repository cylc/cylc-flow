            this setting can be set to ``True`` to allow implicit tasks.
            It is recommended to only set this to ``True`` if required during
            development/prototyping of a workflow graph, but set it to
            ``False`` after finishing the :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc[runtime]`

               The following directories are installed by default:

               * app
               * bin
               * etc
               * lib

               And include the server.key file (from the .service
               directory), this is required for authentication.

               These should be located in the top level of your Cylc workflow,
               i.e. the directory that contains your flow.cylc file.

            Directories must have a trailing slash.

        Conf('cycle point format', VDR.V_CYCLE_POINT_FORMAT, desc='''
            Set the datetime format and precision that Cylc uses for
            :term:`cycle points<cycle point>` in :term:`datetime cycling`
            workflows.

            .. seealso::

               * To alter the time zone used in the datetime cycle point
                 format, see
                 :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc[scheduler]cycle point time zone`.
               * To alter the number of expanded year digits (for years
                 below 0 or above 9999), see
                 :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc
                 [scheduler]cycle point num expanded year digits`.

            By default, Cylc uses a ``CCYYMMDDThhmmZ`` (``Z`` in the special
            case of UTC) or ``CCYYMMDDThhmmÂ±hhmm`` format for writing
            datetime cycle points, following the :term:`ISO 8601` standard.

            You may use the `isodatetime library's syntax
            <https://github.com/metomi/isodatetime#dates-and-times>`_ to set
            the cycle point format.

            You can also use a subset of the strptime/strftime POSIX
            standard - supported tokens are ``%F``, ``%H``, ``%M``, ``%S``,
            ``%Y``, ``%d``, ``%j``, ``%m``, ``%s``, ``%z``.

            If specifying a format here, we recommend including a time zone -
            this will be used for displaying cycle points only. To avoid
            confusion, we recommend using the same time zone as
            :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc[scheduler]cycle point time zone`.

            The ISO 8601 *extended* datetime format (``CCYY-MM-DDThh:mm``)
            cannot be used, as cycle points are used in job-log and work
            directory paths where the ":" character is invalid.

            .. warning::

               The smallest unit included in the format sets the precision
               of cycle points in the workflow.
               If the precision is lower than the smallest unit
               in a graph recurrence, the workflow will fail.
               For example, if you set a format of ``CCYY``, and have a
               recurrence ``R/2000/P8M``, then both the first and second
               cycle points will be ``2000``, which is invalid.
        ''')
        Conf('cycle point num expanded year digits', VDR.V_INTEGER, 0, desc='''
            Enable negative years or years more than four digits long.

            For years below 0 or above 9999, the ISO 8601 standard specifies
            that an extra number of year digits and a sign should be used.
            This extra number needs to be written down somewhere (here).

            For example, if this extra number is set to 2, 00Z on the 1st of
            January in the year 10040 will be represented as
            ``+0100400101T0000Z`` (2 extra year digits used). With this number
            set to 3, 06Z on the 4th of May 1985 would be written as
            ``+00019850504T0600Z``.

            This number defaults to 0 (no sign or extra digits used).

            Time zone to be used for datetime cycle points if not otherwise
            specified.

            This time zone will be used for
            datetime cycle point dumping and inferring the time zone of cycle
            points that are input without time zones.

            Time zones should be expressed as :term:`ISO8601` time zone offsets
            from UTC, such as ``+13``, ``+1300``, ``-0500`` or ``+0645``,
            with ``Z`` representing the special case of ``+0000`` (UTC).
            Cycle points will be converted to the time zone you give and will
            be represented with this string at the end.

            If not set, it will default to UTC (``Z``).

            .. admonition:: Cylc 7 compatibility mode

               In :ref:`Cylc_7_compat_mode`, it will default to the
               local/system time zone, rather than UTC.

            The time zone will persist over reloads/restarts following any
            local time zone changes (e.g. if the
            workflow is run during winter time, then stopped, then restarted
            after summer time has begun, the cycle points will remain
            in winter time). Changing this setting after the workflow has
            first started will have no effect.

            If you use a custom
            :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc[scheduler]cycle point format`, it is a good
            idea to set the same time zone here. If you specify a different
            one here, it will only be used for inferring timezone-less cycle
            points; cycle points will be displayed in the time zone from the
            cycle point format.

            .. caution::

               It is not recommended to write the time zone with a ":"
               (e.g. ``+05:30``), given that the time zone is used as part of
               task output filenames.

               reasonable.

            Set by defining a list of truncated time points, which
            the initial cycle point must match.

            Examples:

            - ``T00, T06, T12, T18`` - only at 6 hourly intervals.
            -  ``T-30`` - only at half-past an hour.

            How many cycles ahead of the slowest tasks the fastest may run.

            Runahead limiting prevents the fastest tasks in a workflow from
            getting too far ahead of the slowest ones, as documented in
            :ref:`RunaheadLimit`.

            This limit on the number of consecutive spawned cycle points is
            specified by an interval between the least and most recent: either
            an integer (e.g. ``P3`` -  works for both :term:`integer cycling`
            and :term:`datetime cycling`), or a time interval (e.g. ``PT12H`` -
            only works for datetime cycling). Alternatively, if a raw number is
            given, e.g. ``7``, it will be taken to mean ``PT7H``, though this
            usage is deprecated.

            .. note::

               The integer limit format is irrespective of the labelling of
               cycle points. For example, if the runahead limit is ``P3`` and
               you have a workflow *solely* consisting of a task that repeats
               "every four cycles", it would still spawn three consecutive
               cycle points at a time (starting with 1, 5 and 9). This is
               because the workflow is functionally equivalent to one where the
               task repeats every cycle.

            .. note::

               The runahead limit may be automatically raised if this is
               necessary to allow a future task to be triggered, preventing
               the workflow from stalling.

        This section is used to specify settings for tasks to be run.

        You can specify:

        - What scripts or commands you want to execute.
        - Which compute resource (platform) you wish to use.
        - How to run your task.

        If multiple tasks need the same settings, they can share settings by
        inheriting them from one or more other tasks.

        Precedence is determined by the same C3
        linearization algorithm used to find the *method resolution order*
        in Python language class hierarchies.

            of namespace names, and repeat as needed to define all tasks in
            the workflow. Names may contain letters, digits, underscores, and
            hyphens.  A namespace represents a group or family of tasks if
            other namespaces inherit from it, or a task if no others inherit
            from it.

            .. important::

                Task job scripts are executed from within *work directories*
                created automatically under the workflow run directory. A task
                can get its own work directory from ``$CYLC_TASK_WORK_DIR``
                (or ``$PWD`` if it does not ``cd`` elsewhere at
                runtime). The default directory path contains task name and
                cycle point, to provide a unique workspace for every instance
                of every task. If several tasks need to exchange files and
                simply read and write from their from current working
                directory, setting ``work sub-directory`` can be used to
                override the default to make them all use the same workspace.

                The top level share and work directory location can be changed
                (e.g. to a large data area) by a global config setting (see
                :cylc:conf:`global.cylc[install][symlink dirs]`).

                .. caution::

                   If you omit cycle point from the work sub-directory path
                   successive instances of the task will share the same
                   workspace. Consider the effect on cycle point offset
                   housekeeping of work directories before doing this.

                Example:

                *This is not intended as an alternative to a
                well-designed inheritance hierarchy that provides each task
                with just the variables it needs.*

                Filters can improve workflows with tasks which inherit a lot
                of environment variables: Filters can make it clear which
                variables each task uses.

                You can use filters as explicit "task environment interfaces".
                They make sure that variables filtered out of the inherited
                environment are not used. However, using filters in this way
                will make your workflow definition longer.

                .. note::
                   Environment filtering is done after inheritance is
                   completely worked out, not at each level on the way, so
                   filter lists in higher-level namespaces only have an effect
                   if they are not overridden by descendants.

                handlers; see :cylc:conf:`flow.cylc[scheduler][events]` for
                workflow event handlers.

                Event handlers can be held in the workflow ``bin/`` directory,
                otherwise it is up to you to ensure their location is in
                ``$PATH`` (in the shell in which the scheduler runs).
                They should require little resource to run and return
                quickly.

                Each task event handler can be specified as a list of command
                lines or command line templates. For a full list of supported
                template variables see :ref:`task_event_template_variables`.

                Supported for use with job runners:

                - pbs
                - slurm
                - loadleveler

                - slurm_packjob
                - moab

                Directives are written to the top of the task job script
                in the correct format for the job runner.

                Specifying directives individually like this allows
                use of default directives for task families which can be
                individually overridden at lower levels of the runtime
                namespace hierarchy.
