"""Plugins for running Python code inside of the Cylc scheduler.

.. _BuiltInPlugins:

Built In Plugins
----------------

Cylc Flow provides the following plugins:

.. autosummary::
   :toctree: built-in
   :template: main_loop_plugin.rst

   cylc.flow.main_loop.auto_restart
   cylc.flow.main_loop.health_check
   cylc.flow.main_loop.log_data_store
   cylc.flow.main_loop.log_main_loop
   cylc.flow.main_loop.log_memory
   cylc.flow.main_loop.reset_bad_hosts

.. Note: Autosummary generates files in this directory, these are cleaned
         up by `make clean`.


Configuring
-----------

Main loop plugins can be activated either by:

* Using the ``--main-loop`` option with ``cylc play`` e.g:

  .. code-block:: console

     $ # run a workflow using the "health check" and "auto restart" plugins:
     $ cylc play my-workflow --main-loop 'health check' \
--main-loop 'auto restart'

* Adding them to the default list of plugins in
  :cylc:conf:`global.cylc[scheduler][main loop]plugins` e.g:

  .. code-block:: cylc

     [scheduler]
         [[main loop]]
             plugins = health check, auto restart

Main loop plugins can be individually configured in their
:cylc:conf:`global.cylc[scheduler][main loop][<plugin name>]` section e.g:

.. code-block:: cylc

   [scheduler]
       [[main loop]]
           [[[health check]]]
               interval = PT5M  # perform check every 5 minutes


Developing Main Loop Plugins
----------------------------

Main loop plugins are Python modules containing asynchronous function(s)
(sometimes referred to as coroutines) which Cylc Flow executes within the
scheduler.

Hello World
^^^^^^^^^^^

Here is the "hello world" of main loop plugins:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: my_plugin.py

   from cylc.flow import LOG
   from cylc.flow.main_loop import startup

   @startup
   async def my_startup_coroutine(schd, state):
      # write Hello <workflow name> to the Cylc log.
      LOG.info(f'Hello {schd.workflow}')

Plugins are registered by registering them with the ``cylc.main_loop``
entry point:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: setup.py

   # plugins must be properly installed, in-place PYTHONPATH meddling will
   # not work.

   from setuptools import setup

   setup(
       name='my-plugin',
       version='1.0',
       py_modules=['my_plugin'],
       entry_points={
          # register this plugin with Cylc
          'cylc.main_loop': [
            # name = python.namespace.of.module
            'my_plugin=my_plugin.my_plugin'
          ]
       }
   )

Examples
^^^^^^^^

For examples see the built-in plugins in the :py:mod:`cylc.flow.main_loop`
module which are registered in the Cylc Flow ``setup.cfg`` file.

Coroutines
^^^^^^^^^^

.. _coroutines: https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#coroutines
.. _aiofiles: https://github.com/Tinche/aiofiles

Plugins provide asynchronous functions (`coroutines`_) which Cylc will
then run inside the scheduler.

Coroutines should be fast running (read as gentle on the scheduler)
and perform IO asynchronously e.g. by using `aiofiles`_.

Coroutines shouldn't meddle with the state of the scheduler and should be
parallel-safe with other plugins.

Event Types
^^^^^^^^^^^

Coroutines must be decorated using one of the main loop decorators. The
choice of decorator effects when the coroutine is called and what
arguments are provided to it.

The available event types are:

.. autofunction:: cylc.flow.main_loop.startup

.. autofunction:: cylc.flow.main_loop.shutdown

.. autofunction:: cylc.flow.main_loop.periodic
