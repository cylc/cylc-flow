"""Log the memory usage of a running scheduler over time.

.. note::

   This plugin is for Cylc developers debugging cylc memory usage.

   For general interest memory measurement try
   ``/usr/bin/time -v cylc play`` or ``cylc play --profile``.

.. note::

   Pympler associates memory with the first object which references it.

   In Cylc we have some objects (e.g. the configuration) which are references
   from multiple places.

   This can result in a certain amount of "jitter" in the results where
   pympler has swapper from associating memory with one object to another.

   Watch out for matching increase/decrease in reported memory in
   different objects.

.. warning::

   This plugin can slow down a scheduler significantly due to the
   complexity of memory calculations.

   Set a sensible interval before running suites.

If ``matplotlib`` is installed this plugin will plot results as a PDF in
the run directory when the scheduler is shut down (cleanly).
