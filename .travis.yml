# Configuration for the Travis continuous integration system
# ==========================================================
# 
# Travis is a free service for running automatic tests on Github repositories.
# This file configures Travis for Cylc, telling it how to install Cylc and run
# the test battery.
# 
# Test results get posted back to Github. By default Travis will run tests on any
# pull requests, adding a comment on the pull request page to say if the tests
# pass or fail, it will also test any new commits, showing the test results on
# the branch page, e.g. https://github.com/cylc/cylc/branches.
# 
# Connecting a Cylc branch
# ------------------------
# 
# To make use of Travis you will first need to create a fork of Cylc in Github.
# Log in to https://travis-ci.org using your Github credentials, it will ask for
# permission to see your repositories, set the status of branches (whether the
# build passes or fails tests) and create hooks so Travis gets notified of new
# commits.
# 
# Travis will create a list of all of your public Github repositories, you can
# enable automatic tests for a repository using the switches in this list.
# 
# More information for Travis can be found at http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/

# General environment setup before we start installing stuff
before_install:
    # Clear bashrc - the default does nothing if not in an interactive shell.
    # SSH connections use the ~/.bashrc file for their environment, so we'll be
    # loading our python environment here.
    - echo > ~/.bashrc

    # Setup virtualenv (using system packages for pygtk as pip won't install it)
    - virtualenv --system-site-packages $HOME/virtualenv/cylc 
    - echo "source $HOME/virtualenv/cylc/bin/activate" >> ~/.bashrc

    # Make sure Cylc is in PATH when running jobs
    - echo "export PATH=$PWD/bin:\$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc

    # Load our new environment
    - source ~/.bashrc


# These commands are run before the test
install: 
    # Setup local SSH for Cylc jobs
    - ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -N "" -q

    # Install dependencies
    - sudo apt-get install build-essential
    - sudo apt-get install at python-pip python-dev libgraphviz-dev # python-gtk2-dev

# Run tests

    # TESTS defines what tests to run
    # The following failures appear to be artefacts of running on Travis
    # lib/parsec/tests  - Cannot find 'validate' library in lib/parsec
