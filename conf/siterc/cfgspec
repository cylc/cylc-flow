#>   (2) Uncomment and modify specific configuration items as required.

# SUITE HOST SELF-IDENTIFICATION: The suite host's identity, by NAME or
# IP ADDRESS, must be determined locally by cylc and passed to task
# execution environments as $CYLC_SUITE_HOST so that tasks can send
# messages back.  If name is used, the host name determined on the suite
# host must resolve, on the task host, to the external IP address of the
# suite host. Otherwise the external IP address of the suite host, as
# seen by the task host, must be determined on the suite host, which is
# not always easy to do.  Cylc requires a special "target address" to do
# this; see documentation in $CYLC_DIR/lib/cylc/suite_host.py for why.
# (TO DO: is it conceivable that different remote task hosts at the same
# site might see the suite host differently? If so we would need to be
# able to override the target in suite definitions.)
