#> This is a ConfigObj configspec for cylc site and user configuration.
#> All legal configuration items and default values are defined below.

#> HOW TO CUSTOMIZE SETTINGS FOR YOUR SITE:
#>   *** Do not modify this configspec file ***
#>   (1) Run "cylc get-global-config --write-site" to generate the file
#>       $CYLC_DIR/conf/site.rc with all default settings commented out.
#>   (2) Uncomment and modify specific configuration items as required.
#>----------------------------------------------------------------------
#> HOW TO CUSTOMIZE SETTINGS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL USER:
#>   *** Do not modify this configspec file ***
#>   (1) Run "cylc get-global-config --write-user" to generate the file 
#>       $HOME/.cylc/cylc.rc with all default settings commented out.
#>   (2) Uncomment and modify specific configuration items as required.
#>----------------------------------------------------------------------
#>   NOTE THAT SITE AND/OR USER CONFIG IS REQUIRED ON TASK HOSTS TOO

# Sections or items preceded by "# SITE ONLY" can not be set by users.

# resolve, on the task host, to the external IP address of the suite
# host. Otherwise the external IP address of the suite host, as seen by
# the task host, must be determined on the suite host, which is not
# always easy to do. Cylc requires a special "target address" to do
# this; see documentation in $CYLC_DIR/lib/cylc/suite_host.py for why.
# (TO DO: is it conceivable that different remote task hosts at the same
# site might see the suite host differently? If so we would need to be
# able to override the target in suite definitions.)
