#> This is a ConfigObj configspec for cylc site and user configuration.
#> All legal configuration items and default values are defined below. 
#>----------------------------------------------------------------------
#> HOW TO CUSTOMIZE SETTINGS FOR YOUR SITE:
#>   *** Do not modify this configspec file ***
#>   (1) Run "cylc get-global-config --write-site" to generate the file
#>       $CYLC_DIR/conf/site.rc with all default settings commented out.
#>   (2) UNCOMMENT and modify specific configuration items as required.
#>----------------------------------------------------------------------
#> HOW TO CUSTOMIZE SETTINGS FOR A USER (this overrides the site file):
#>   *** Do not modify this configspec file ***
#>   (1) Run "cylc get-global-config --write-user" to generate the file 
#>       $HOME/.cylc/cylc.rc with all default settings commented out.
#>   (2) UNCOMMENT and modify specific configuration items as required.
#>----------------------------------------------------------------------
#> Comments starting with "#>" are not passed on to generated .rc files.

# Sections or items preceded by "# SITE ONLY" can not be set by users.
#> (trailing comments don't get passed on to generated config files)
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------
# For display items unset by default are commented out with value 'None'.
# To unset an item in reality, don't use 'None' - just comment it out.

# SUITE HOST SELF-IDENTIFICATION: The suite host's identity, by NAME or
# IP ADDRESS, must be determined locally by cylc and passed to task
# execution environments as $CYLC_SUITE_HOST so that tasks can send
# messages back.  If name is used, the host name determined on the suite
# host must resolve, on the task host, to the external IP address of the
# suite host. Otherwise the external IP address of the suite host, as
# seen by the task host, must be determined on the suite host, which is
# not always easy to do.  Cylc requires a special "target address" to do
# this; see documentation in $CYLC_DIR/lib/cylc/suite_host.py for why.
# (TO DO: is it conceivable that different remote task hosts at the same
# site might see the suite host differently? If so we would need to be
# able to override the target in suite definitions.)
