    [[default]]
        # Default theme rationale:
        # * States representing something that happened external to cylc
        # are solid; those representing a task proxy states purely
        # internal to cylc are hollow. Thus pre-submitted states, and
        # the retry state, are hollow.
        # * Normal states are pleasant shades of grey, blue, or green.
        # * Failure states are bright red ('submit-failed' is hollow).
        # * The 'running' state is solid green. The 'queued',
        #   'ready', and 'submitted' states are different
        #   shades of yellow-to-green to indicate "almost running".
        # * The operator-held state is pink, to indicate an abnormal but
        #   non-threatening state.
        # * The 'succeeded' state is uninteresting, hence grey.
        # * The 'retry' states are hollow (pre-running) orange (almost red)
        #   as a failure has occurred but we're doing something about it.
        # * The 'waiting' state is light blue.
