# THIS SPEC FILE DEFINES ALL LEGAL ENTRIES IN CYLC SUITE.RC FILES.
# LaTeX documentation is maintained below each item, in comments that

# NOTE: A CONFIGOBJ or VALIDATE BUG? LIST CONSTRUCTOR FAILS IF LAST LIST
# ELEMENT IS FOLLOWED BY A SPACE (OR DOES IT JUST NEED A TRAILING COMMA?):
#   GOOD:
# foo = string_list( default=list('foo','bar'))
#   BAD:
# bar = string_list( default=list('foo','bar' ))

#> \subsection{Include Files}
#> \label{IncludeFiles}
#> Include-files can be used to help organize the task definition
#> sections of large suites, or to group common environment variable settings
#> into one file that can be included in multiple task environment sections 
#> (instead of polluting the global namespace for {\em all} tasks).
#> Include-file boundaries are arbitrary (they can cross suite.rc 
#> section boundaries). They can be multiply included and nested.
#> \begin{lstlisting}
#>%include path/to/myfile.rc
#> \end{lstlisting}
#> Include-file paths should be specified portably\footnote{If the suite
#> is copied to another location you shouldn't have to change hardwired
#> paths.} relative to the suite definition directory.
#> The \lstinline=cylc edit= command can optionally provide an inlined 
#> version of a suite.rc file that is automatically split back into 
#> its constituent include-files when you save the file and exit the editor.

#> into a serious problem (e.g.\ critical inputs not available).
