CYLC DEV NOTES

________________________
update-tutorial-tests.sh

This script does the following for suites under examples/tutorial/:

1) it (re)makes symlinks to all suites
2) it runs cylc to generate a reference log for any suite that does
   not already have one.
3) it (re)makes the ".t" test scripts for all suites.

After adding a new tutorial suite, run this script and commit the
resulting '.t' test script and suite reference log.

After changing an existing tutorial suite, delete its reference log
under reference-logs/, run this script and commit the resulting log.

All symlinks and .t scripts are regenerated each time, because that
takes no time; ref logs are not, because that takes a few minutes.

The suites are slightly modified on the fly, as described below, before
running them to generate the reference logs.

_________
THE TESTS

The example suites are modified slightly, by test_header_tutorial, after
installation to the temporary test directory so that the originals don't
have to be complicated by reference test configuration details.
 1) set task 'sleep' intervals to zero, to make tasks run faster
 2) replace any 'host = HOST' item with 'host = $CYLC_TEST_TASK_HOST'
 3) detect and declare expected task failures (else the test will abort)
 4) set initial and final cycle times to cover two 12-hourly cycles 

 ASSUMPTIONS: - failed tasks are automatically cleaned up by the suite
 (else the suite will time out) cycling suites are on a 12-hour cycle
 (else the modified test suite will not run two cycles). If new tutorial
 suites violate these assumptions test_header_tutorial will need changes.
