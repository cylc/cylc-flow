# Tests

Cylc-flow has three tiers of tests:

| Test Type | Command | Docs |
|---|---|---|
| Unit Tests | `pytest` | [README](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/blob/master/tests/unit/README.md) |
| Integration tests | `pytest tests/integration` | [README](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/blob/master/tests/integration/README.md) |
| Functional Tests | `etc/bin/run-functional-tests` | [README](https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/blob/master/tests/functional/README.md) |

The README files in each directory explain what sort of tests should go into
which directory, how to run and debug these tests.
