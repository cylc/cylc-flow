description = """Task run_kill fails silently - it will be stuck in 'running'
unless polled. Task run_kill goes to Task submit_hold. Task poll_check_kill 
then polls all to find if any tasks have failed, allowing run_kill to suicide
via a :fail trigger. Task submit_hold is an idle task which is killed after
Task poll_check_kill succeds by Task poll_now. Task poll_now then polls all
to find if any tasks, allowing submit_hold to suicide via a :submit-fail
trigger, and the suite to shut down successfully."""
