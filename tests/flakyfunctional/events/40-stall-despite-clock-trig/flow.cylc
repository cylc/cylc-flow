# Stall due to unhandled failure of t2
# TODO: I think this test can be removed. Since SoD it only tests that a suite
# can stall due to unhandled failed tasks, which is tested elsewhere. It was
# probably meant to test that stall was not affected by the clock trigger on
# waiting t1 in the next cycle under SoS.
