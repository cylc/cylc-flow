# Test that removing the DB quickly after a shutdown does not cause it to be
# regenerated due to any outstanding connection to the DB.
# NOTE: this test is not guaranteed to catch the issue, but is more likely
# to do so on slower filesystems. However, faster filesystems are
# less likely to have the original issue in the first place. See
