    See: https://github.com/cylc/cylc-flow/issues/6261

    We hope to get users into the habit of "cylc vip" to create a new run,
    and "cylc vr" to contine an old one (picking up any new changes in the
    process).

    If there are no changes to reinstall (or if the user chooses not to
    resintall) the "cylc vr" prompts whether to continue or do nothing.

    The "nothing to reinstall" situation can be interpreted two ways:
    1. Unexpected error, the user expected there to be something to reinstall,
       but there wasn't. E.g, they forgot to press save.
    2. Unexpected annoyance, I wanted to restart the workflow, just do it.

    To handle this we explain that there are no changes to reinstall and
    prompt the user to see if they want to press save or restart the workflow.
