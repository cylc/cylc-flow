# A clock-triggered data-gathering task, a warm-cycled model, and two
# post-processing tasks (one runs every second cycle). The tasks are not
# cylc-aware, have independently configured I/O directories, and abort
# if their input files do not exist. This suite gets them all to run out
# of a common I/O workspace (although the warm-cycled model uses a
# private running directory for its restart files).
