description = """Any task job script may fail regardless of user runtime
settings if changes to cylc re-order the job script sections badly: e.g.
"cylc task started" must be called after the CYLC_ environment variables
are exported. Additionally, users may rely on the order of variable
definition in each environment and script section: e.g. suite
bin directory must go in PATH before the task runtime environment is
defined because suite bin commands could be used in variable assignment
expressions."""
