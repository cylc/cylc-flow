Site/user configuration required for e.g. the 'loadleveler' test:

[test battery]
    [[batch systems]]
        [[[loadleveler]]]
            host = my.loadleveler.host # required
            [[[[directives]]]]         # optional
                class = General
                account_no = HAFS1301

If 'host' for a batch system is not supplied, the test will be skipped.

Any 'directives' supplied will be added to those used in the
test suite.  This can be used, for instance, to override 'class =
serial' in the suite if your site does not have a 'serial' class; and to
add a job accounting code, if that is required at your site.
