External trigger events should stimulate task processing without requiring a
manual suite nudge, even when nothing else is happening in the suite. Here,
long-running task bar ext-triggers foo when nothing else is happening. If
task processing occurs foo will submit and kill bar, allowing the suite
to shutdown.  Otherwise, foo won't submit, bar will keep running, and the suite
will time out."""
