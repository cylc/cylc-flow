        External trigger events should stimulate task processing even when
        nothing else is happening in the suite. Here, long-running task bar
        ext-triggers foo when nothing else is happening. If task processing
        occurs foo will submit and kill bar, allowing the suite to shutdown.
        Otherwise, foo won't submit, bar will keep running, and the suite will
        time out.
