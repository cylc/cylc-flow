        External trigger events should stimulate task processing even when
        nothing else is happening in the workflow. Here, long-running task bar
        ext-triggers foo when nothing else is happening. If task processing
        occurs foo will submit and kill bar, allowing the workflow to shutdown.
        Otherwise, foo won't submit, bar will keep running, and the workflow will
        time out.
