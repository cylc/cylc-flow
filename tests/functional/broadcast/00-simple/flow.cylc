The initial prep task in this workflow broadcasts an environment variable
"BCAST" to various cycles and namespaces, then each task writes its cycle
time, name, and its value of BCAST to a special log file. Finally, the
shutdown event handler compares the broadcast log file with a previously
generated reference version.
