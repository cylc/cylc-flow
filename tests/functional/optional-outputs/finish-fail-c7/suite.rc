# When a task with a finish trigger fails:
# Cylc 7:
#   No runahead stall (failed tasks ignored) but stall due to failed tasks at FCP
# Cylc 8 back-compat mode:
#   Replicate Cylc 7 behaviour by making success outputs required and ignoring
#   incomplete tasks in runahead computation.
# Cylc 8 non-back-compat mode:
#   No runahead stall and no stall at FCP, because :finish implies success optional.
