# Check that a specified flow can be stopped without affecting the main flow.
# Here baz triggers a new flow then waits for the second baz to finish.
# Meanwhile the second bar stops its own flow. So order events should be:
# 1.  foo => bar => baz (flow a)
# 2.  foo => bar (flow b)
# 3.  qux (flow a)
