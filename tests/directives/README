Site/user configuration required for this test:

[test battery]

    [[directives]]  # (test name)
        loadleveler host = my.loadleveler.host # required

        [[[loadleveler directives]]]           # optional
            class = General
            account_no = HAFS1301

If 'loadleveler host' is not supplied, the test will be skipped.

Any 'loadleveler directives' supplied will be added to those used in the
test suite.  This can be used, for instance, to override 'class =
serial' in the suite if your site does not have a 'serial' class; and to
add a job accounting code, if that is required at your site.
