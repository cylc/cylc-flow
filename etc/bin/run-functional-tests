Usage: run-functional-tests [...]

Run the Cylc test battery, in <CYLC_REPO_DIR>/tests.

Options and arguments are appended to "prove -j \$NPROC -s -r \${@:-tests/f}".
NPROC is the number of concurrent processes to run, which defaults to the
global config "process pool size" setting.

The tests ignore normal site/user global config and instead use:
   <site-global-config>/flow-tests.rc
   <user-global-config>/flow-tests.rc
   (See "cylc get-global --print-site-dir/--print-user-dir for locations).
These should specify test job hosts under the [test battery] section, plus any
other critical settings settings, including [hosts] configuration for test job
hosts (and special batchview commands like qcat if available). Additional
global config items can be added on the fly using the create_test_globalrc
shell function defined in the test_header.

Suite run directories are only cleaned up for passing tests on the suite host.

Set "export CYLC_TEST_DEBUG=true" to print failed-test stderr to the terminal.

To change the test file comparision command from "diff -u" do (for example):
   export CYLC_TEST_DIFF_CMD='xxdiff -D'

Some test suites submit jobs to the 'at' so atd must be up on the job hosts.

Commits or Pull Requests to cylc/cylc-flow on GitHub will trigger
GitHub Actions to run tests, see .github/workflows for details.

By default all tests are executed.  To run just a subset of them:
  * list individual tests or test directories to run on the command line
  * list individual tests or test directories to skip in \$CYLC_TEST_SKIP
  * skip all generic tests with CYLC_TEST_RUN_GENERIC=false
  * skip all platform-specific tests with CYLC_TEST_RUN_PLATFORM=false
  List specific tests relative to \$CYLC_REPO_DIR (i.e. starting with "test/").
Some platform-specific tests are automatically skipped, depending on platform.

Platform-specific tests must set "CYLC_TEST_IS_GENERIC=false" before sourcing
the test_header.

Options:
  -h, --help       Print this help message and exit.

Examples:

Run the full test suite with the default options.
  run-functional-tests
Run the full test suite with 12 processes
  run-functional-tests -j 12
Run only tests under "tests/f/cyclers/"
  run-functional-tests tests/f/cyclers
Run only "tests/f/cyclers/16-weekly.t" in verbose mode
  run-functional-tests -v tests/f/cyclers/16-weekly.t
Run only tests under "tests/f/cyclers/", and skip 00-daily.t
  export CYLC_TEST_SKIP=tests/f/cyclers/00-daily.t
  run-functional-tests tests/f/cyclers
Run the first quarter of the test battery
  CHUNK=1/4 run-functional-tests
Re-run failed tests
  run-functional-tests --state=save
  run-functional-tests --state=failed
