swarm [OPTIONS] (build|configure|run)

Build, configure and run a swarm of docker containers for test purposes.

This swarm is both for local development and automated testing to provide
a stable testing/development platform.

Containers ports are correctly exposed so they can be used either natively
or in virtual machines.

Commands:
    build        Build docker images.
    configure    Configure system ssh and cylc configuration files.
    deconfigure  Undo configuration changes.
    interactive  Run a docker container interactively.
    run          Run docker containers.
    ps           List running detached containers started with "run"
    kill         Kill detached containers started with "run"

Note:
    "ps" and "kill" only track the most resent swarm of containers started
    by "run".

Options:
    -y --yes    Don't prompt.
    --debug     Runs the script with set -x for debug.

Basic usage:
    $ swarm configure
    $ swarm build
    $ swarm run
    $ run-functional-tests -p all tests/f
    $ swarm kill
    $ swarm deconfigure

Virtual Machines and Docker Desktop:
    All containers in this swarm should work when run in a virtual machine
    (e.g. VirtualBox, Docker Desktop for Mac OS or Windows, etc).

The Containers:
    This "swarm" is made up of several containers.

    * Each container exposes its SSH port (22).
    * The SSH config maps these ports onto hostnames.
    * The Cylc config maps hostnames onto test platforms.

    See tests/functional/README.md for more information on the test
    platform matrix.

Running Tests Without The Swarm:
    Configure the platforms with the same names as the swarm platforms.

    For example if you have a remote host compatible with TCP comms you
    could configure it like so:

    [platforms]
        [[_remote_background_indep_tcp]]
            host = my_remote_host

    NOTE: You will have to have ensure you have the same branch installed
          on the remote hosts as on your local host. Remember to pip install.

Caveats:
    For TCP comms the firewall on the Docker host must accept packets from
    containers on the "docker0" network adapter. You may need to configure
    iptables for this, e.g.:
        $ sudo iptables -A INPUT -i docker0 -j ACCEPT
    This must appear early in the table to avoid preemption by reject or drop.
        $ sudo iptables-save > iptables.txt
        $ # (edit iptables.txt to put the new line above other INPUT lines).
        $ sudo iptables-restore < iptables.txt

    At present TCP comms are not possible FROM the host TO the container.
    This is not generally an issue as the standard test approach is to run
    a workflow on the host submitting its jobs to the container.

    However some of the shared filesystem tests actually run entire workflows
    inside the container. Communicating with these workflows FROM the host
    is not possible at present (perhaps if you meddle /etc/hosts you *might*
    be able to get it to work generally - note containers running in VMs
    make this an interesting problem).

Port Mapping:
    Each container uses one port to enable SSH, the SSH config maps these
    ports to hostnames. The ports are as follows:

    Job Runner:
        * 42200 - "background/at"

    Filesystem:
        * +20 - "indep"
        * +30 - "shared"

    Comms Method:
        * +0 - "tcp" & "ssh"
        * +1 - "poll"
