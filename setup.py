        This class extends the Sphinx command class for setuptools. With
        a difference that it tries to mimic the behaviour of the previous
        `cylc-make-docs`.

        So first it will execute `make-commands.sh`, which builds the
        commands help information, in the appendices.

        Then, instead of calling one builder, this class will call the
        builder for the single HTML, and also the builder for the multiple
        HTML documentation.

        Finally, one more tweak in this class is to move the doctrees
        folder (in the same level as the documentation) to within the
        documentation folder, named `.doctrees`, as before with
        `cylc-make-docs`.
